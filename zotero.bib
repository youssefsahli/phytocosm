	volume = {18},

	doi = {10.1111/jocd.12927},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The skin exposome refers to the constellation of external exposures that contribute to cutaneous aging, including solar radiation, air pollution, tobacco smoke, unbalanced nutrition, and cosmetic products. This review explores the skin exposome and the role of a combination hyaluronic acid and mineralized thermal water product used to restore and maintain optimal skin barrier function.
{METHOD}: An expert panel of 7 dermatologists who treat clinical signs of facial aging convened for a one-day meeting to discuss the results of a literature review on the skin exposome and the role of M89, a mineralized thermal water and hyaluronic acid-based gel, to improve the quality of facial skin. Evidence coupled with expert opinion and experience of the panel was used to address clinical challenges in the treatment of photo-aging, and the use of M89.
{RESULTS}: Solar radiation (ultraviolet radiation, visible light, and infrared radiation), air pollution, tobacco smoke, nutrition, and miscellaneous factors, including stress, sleep deprivation, and temperature, may potentiate skin aging by triggering molecular processes that damage skin structure. M89 was developed to maintain and restore skin and contains ingredients to aid physical, hydric, antioxidant, and antimicrobial skin barrier function.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Increasing knowledge of the exposome and microenvironment contributing to skin aging may support a better understanding of measures to support the skin. The initial results of in vitro and clinical studies of M89 show its potential to improve skin barrier function.},

              ‐Bisabolol is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene alcohol which was first isolated from
              Matricaria chamomilla
              (Asteraceae) in the twentieth century and has since been identified in other aromatic plants such as
              Eremanthus erythropappus
              ,
              Smyrniopsis aucheri

              α
              ‐bisabolol was identified as a major constituent of
              Salvia runcinata
              essential oil, a plant indigenous to South Africa. The use of
              α
              ‐bisabolol or bisabolol‐rich oil as an anti‐inflammatory agent is ubiquitous. This compound also exhibits several other pharmacological properties such as analgesic, antibiotic and anticancer activities. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity of bisabolol have also been investigated. Due to the low toxicity associated with bisabolol the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) has granted this constituent with Generally Regarded as Safe ({GRAS}) status which has promoted its use as an active ingredient in several commercial products. This review aims to summarise the role of
              α
              ‐bisabolol in pharmacological and/or physiological processes and to discuss some of the possible mechanisms of action of this commercially important molecule.},

In in vivo situations, polyphenolic anthranoids are extensively broken down into glucuronides and sulfate metabolites by the gut and the liver. The anti-inflammatory potential of aloe metabolites has not been examined. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of aloe metabolites from in vitro (lipopolysaccharides ({LPS})-activated {RAW}264.7 macrophages) and ex vivo ({LPS}-activated peritoneal macrophages) to in vivo ({LPS}-induced septic mice). The production of proinflammatory cytokines ({TNF}-

α
α
, {IL}-12, and {NO}, and suppressed the phosphorylation of {MAPKs} by {LPS}-activated {RAW}264.7 macrophages. In addition, aloe metabolites reduced the production of {NO}, {TNF}-
α
α
 and {IL}-12 by murine peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, aloe administration significantly reduced the {NO} level and exhibited protective effects against sepsis-related death in {LPS}-induced septic mice. These results suggest that aloe metabolites exerted anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, and that these effects were associated with the inhibition of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, aloe could be considered an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of sepsis.},

Exceptions are the vermillion border of the lips, external ear canal, nail beds, glans penis, clitoris, and labia minora, which do not contain sweat glands. The thick skin covering the palms of hands and soles of feet lacks all skin appendages except sweat glands (see Image. Cross Section, Layers of the Skin). Apocrine sweat glands, or odoriferous sweat glands, are known for producing malodorous perspiration. They are large, branched glands, mostly confined to the axillary and perineal regions, including the perianal region, labia majora in women, and the scrotum and prepuce in men.

	abstract = {Skin and soft tissue infections are quite common in elderly people. A number of special conditions and circumstances need to be considered in the diagnosis and therapy. It is important to try to establish the causative organism, exclude other cutaneous disorders and identify precipitating factors. Treatment modalities include antiseptics, topical and systemic antibacterials, dressings and biotherapy. Skin infections presenting with erythema, blisters, pustules, and ulcerations or in body folds are described in detail. Cellulitis and infected ulcers are the most commonly encountered cutaneous infections in the elderly. Accurate and quick diagnosis and treatment are imperative to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. Appropriate antibacterials, antiseptics and dressings are necessary depending on the severity of the clinical presentation and resistance patterns. Laboratory tests, such as skin swabs, to establish the exact pathogen take time and the results might represent colonisation rather than infection of the skin. Cellulitis should be clinically distinguished from erysipelas and necrotising fasciitis. The latter is a life-threatening condition, which in the majority of cases requires surgical debridement of the infected tissue. Blisters and honey-coloured crusts are typical features of impetigo. It is very contagious and close contacts should be examined. Folliculitis is a commonly seen skin infection, which often responds to the use of antiseptics and topical antibacterials. More severe pustular skin eruptions, such as furunculosis and carbunculosis, usually require treatment with systemic antibacterials. Intertrigo and erythrasma have a predilection for the body folds, especially the axillae and groin, and topical therapy is usually sufficient. Secondary skin infections are often the result of persistent pruritus associated with increasing dryness of the aging skin. Emollients and antihistamines are useful measures. Primary cutaneous disorders and systemic diseases should be excluded with the aid of appropriate investigations, such as blood tests and skin biopsy. Staphylococcus aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci are the most common causative organisms of cutaneous infections.},

              Objective
              The study was undertaken to compare the skin care related activities of retinol and bakuchiol, a potential alternative to retinoids. Retinol is a pivotal regulator of differentiation and growth of developing as well as adult skin. Retinoic acid is the major physiologically active metabolite of retinol regulating gene expression through retinoic acid receptor – dependant and independent pathways.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Comparative gene expression profiling of both substances in the {EpiDerm}
                {FT}
                full thickness skin substitute model was undertaken. Furthermore, type I, {III} and {IV} collagen, as well as aquaporin 3 expression was analyzed by {ELISA} and/or histochemistry in human dermal fibroblasts and/or Epiderm {FT} skin substitutes.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Bakuchiol is a meroterpene phenol abundant in seeds and leaves of the plant
                Psoralea corylifolia
                . We present evidence that bakuchiol, having no structural resemblance to retinoids, can function as a functional analogue of retinol. Volcano plots showed great overall similarity of retinol and bakuchiol effects on the gene expression profile. This similarity was confirmed by the side‐by‐side comparison of the modulation of individual genes, as well as on the protein level by {ELISA} and histochemistry. Retinol‐like functionality was further confirmed for the upregulation of types I and
                {IV}
                collagen in
                {DNA}
                microarray study and also show stimulation of type
                {III}
                collagen in the mature fibroblast model. Bakuchiol was also formulated into a finished skin care product and was tested in clinical case study by twice‐a‐day facial application. The results showed that, after 12 weeks treatment, significant improvement in lines and wrinkles, pigmentation, elasticity, firmness and overall reduction in photo‐damage was observed, without usual retinol therapy‐associated undesirable effects.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Based on these data, we propose that bakuchiol can function as an anti‐ageing compound through retinol‐like regulation of gene expression.

            Résumé
            
              Objectif
              L'étude a été menée pour comparer les activités liées aux soins de la peau du rétinol et du bakuchiol, une alternative potentielle aux rétinoïdes. Le rétinol est un régulateur essentiel de la différenciation et de la croissance de la peau en développement ainsi que la peau des adultes. L'acide rétinoïque est le principal métabolite physiologiquement actif du rétinol qui régule l'expression des gènes par des voies dépendantes et indépendantes du récepteur de l'acide rétinoïque.
            
            
              Méthodes
              
                Un profilage comparatif d'expression génétique de ces deux substances dans le modèle substitut de la peau {EpiDerm}
                {FT}
                a été entrepris. La synthèse des collagènes de type I,
                {III}
                et
                {IV}
                et de l'aquaporine 3 dans des fibroblastes dermiques humains normaux ont été analysés par
                {ELISA}
                et/ou en histochimie dans le modèle de peau {EpiDerm}
                {TM} {FT}
                .
              
            
            
              Résultats
              
                Bakuchiol est un phénol meroterpène abondant dans les graines et les feuilles de la
                Psoralea corylifolia
                . Nous présentons des preuves que bakuchiol, n'ayant aucune ressemblance structurelle avec les rétinoïdes, peut fonctionner comme un analogue fonctionnel de rétinol. Les diagrammes de type Volcano montrent la grande similitude de l'effet du rétinol et du bakuchiol sur l'expression des gènes. Cette ressemblance a été aussi démontrée par la comparaison de la modulation de l'expression de gènes particulaires, appartenant a de différentes groupes fonctionnelles. La fonctionnalité rétinol ‐like a été confirmée par la régulation à la hausse du collagène de type I et
                {IV}
                et aquaporine 3 au niveau de proteines par {ELISA} et histochimie. Le bakuchiol a également été formulé dans un produit de soin de la peau et a été testé dans une étude clinique avec deux applications par jour au visage. Les résultats ont montré que, après le traitement de douze semaines, une amélioration significative a été observée dans les rides et ridules, la pigmentation, l'élasticité, la fermeté et la réduction globale des dommages du photo‐vieillissement, sans les effets indésirables habituels associés à la thérapie au rétinol.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Sur la base de ces données, nous proposons que le bakuchiol peut fonctionner comme un composé anti‐ vieillissement grâce à la réglementation de l'expression des gènes similaire au rétinol.},

	abstract = {Barbaloin is the major anthraquinone compound that is isolated from the leaf exudates of Aloe vera and is often used as a bittering agent in alcoholic beverages. Here, we investigated the potential protective role of barbaloin in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced acute lung injury ({ALI}) and clarified the underlying mechanism in vitro. Histological analysis showed that barbaloin exhibited a certain protective effect on {LPS}-induced {ALI}. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the actions of barbaloin, {LPS}-stimulated macrophages were used in this study. The results showed that barbaloin decreased the phosphorylation levels of {IκBα} and {NF}-κB p65, leading to a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ({TNF}-α, {IL}-1β and {IL}-6). Furthermore, barbaloin also reduced the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) similarly to the antioxidant N‑acetyl‑l‑cysteine ({NAC}), which alone repressed the {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase ({PI}3K) and {AKT}. Additionally, a pharmacological inhibitor of {PI}3K/{AKT}, {LY}294002, also restrained the phosphorylation levels of {IκBα} and {NF}-κB p65 and thereby decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, these results show that barbaloin possesses a protective effect on {LPS}-induced {ALI} via suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the {ROS}-mediated {PI}3K/{AKT}/{NF}-κB pathway.},

Keratinocytes make up the main cellular constitute of the outermost layer of the skin, contributing to the formation of the epidermis, and they are crucial for maintaining the integrity of this barrier. Beyond serving as a physical barrier component, keratinocytes actively participate in maintaining tissue homeostasis, shaping, amplifying, and regulating immune responses in skin. Keratinocytes act as sentinels, continuously monitoring changes in the environment, and, through microbial sensing, stretch, or other physical stimuli, can initiate a broad range of inflammatory responses via secretion of various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. This diverse function of keratinocytes contributes to the highly variable clinical manifestation of skin immune responses. In this Review, we highlight the highly diverse functions of epidermal keratinocytes and their contribution to various immune-mediated skin diseases.},

As the body's first line of defense, the skin is continuously exposed to environmental stressors, necessitating a robust network of signaling molecules to maintain homeostasis. Considering the main cellular components to be keratinocytes, melanocytes, fibroblasts, and fibrous components, collagen of various types, this review explores the intricate signaling mechanisms that govern skin integrity, focusing on key pathways involved in impacts of ageing and environment factors on skin health. The role of growth factors, cytokines, hormones and other molecular mediators in these processes is examined. Specially for women, decrease of estrogen is determinant to alter signaling and to compromise skin structure, especially the dermis. Environmental factors, such as ultraviolet rays and pollution alongside the impact of ageing on signaling pathways, especially {TGF}-β and proteases (metalloproteinases and cathepsins). Furthermore, with advancing age, the skin's capacity to shelter microbiome challenges diminishes, leading to alterations in signal transduction and subsequent functional decline. Understanding these age-related changes is essential for developing targeted therapies aimed at enhancing skin health and resilience, but also offers a promising avenue for the treatment of skin disorders and the promotion of healthy ageing.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previous studies on the age-, climate, and skin care habit-related changes of biophysical parameters have mainly focused on Caucasians, and studies on Asians are in paucity.
{OBJECTIVE}: This study was aimed to investigate the variations of cutaneous biophysical parameters in Chinese and Korean women (northeast Asians) and to assess the association between those parameters and age, climate, and cosmetic habits.
{METHODS}: A cross-sectional study included 361 healthy Chinese and Korean women between 18 and 49 years of age in 4 cities (Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Shijiazhuang in China, and Suwon in Korea). We measured skin surface temperature, hydration, transepidermal water loss ({TEWL}), sebum, elasticity, skin pore, wrinkle, and skin tone (brightness) using non-invasive instruments. Demographic profiles and cosmetic habits were assessed using a questionnaire.
{RESULTS}: Skin elasticity and tone decreased, and pore size and wrinkle increased with age. Subjects in Suwon (Korean) showed higher hydration level, lower {TEWL} and lower sebum, less severe wrinkle and brighter skin than those in the 3 cities in China. After adjusting for age and region, using sunscreen everyday, wearing base makeup daily, and using moisturizers improved hydration, {TEWL}, and elasticity significantly.
{CONCLUSION}: Women in Suwon (Korea) were found to have a better profile of biophysical parameters than women in the 3 Chinese cities, which might be attributed to cosmetic habits, besides age and climatic factors. The fact that appropriate cosmetic habits are associated with favorable skin biophysical parameters underscores the importance of daily skin care routine in preserving skin functions.},

	abstract = {As the population of postmenopausal women increases, interest in the effects of estrogen grows. The influence of estrogen on several body systems has been well-documented; however, one area that has not been explored is the effects of estrogen on skin. Estrogen appears to aid in the prevention of skin aging in several ways. This reproductive hormone prevents a decrease in skin collagen in postmenopausal women; topical and systemic estrogen therapy can increase the skin collagen content and therefore maintain skin thickness. In addition, estrogen maintains skin moisture by increasing acid mucopolysaccharides and hyaluronic acid in the skin and possibly maintaining stratum corneum barrier function. Sebum levels are higher in postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy. Skin wrinkling also may benefit from estrogen as a result of the effects of the hormone on the elastic fibers and collagen. Outside of its influence on skin aging, it has been suggested that estrogen increases cutaneous wound healing by regulating the levels of a cytokine. In fact, topical estrogen has been found to accelerate and improve wound healing in elderly men and women. The role of estrogen in scarring is unclear but recent studies indicate that the lack of estrogen or the addition of tamoxifen may improve the quality of scarring. Unlike skin aging, the role of endogenous and exogenous estrogen in melanoma has not been well established.},

Preliminary reports using less complete analysis suggest that certain catechins and their metabolites are found in skin biopsies and blister fluid after consumption of green tea; however, it is not known if they are affected by solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) or whether conjugated forms, with consequently altered bioactivity, are present. The present study tested the hypothesis that {UVR} affects the catechin levels in the skin of healthy volunteers after consumption of green tea and how catechins in the plasma are related to their presence in skin tissue samples. In an open oral intervention study, 11 subjects consumed green tea and vitamin C supplements daily for 3months. Presupplementation and postsupplementation plasma samples, suction blister fluid and skin biopsies were collected; the latter two samples were collected both before and after {UVR}. A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric assay was used to measure the intact catechin metabolites, conjugates and free forms. Seven green tea catechins and their corresponding metabolites were identified postsupplementation in skin biopsies, 20 in blister fluid and 26 in plasma, with 15 green tea catechin metabolites present in both blister fluid and plasma. The valerolactone, O-methyl-M4-O-sulfate, a gut microbiota metabolite of catechins, was significantly increased 1.6-fold by {UVR} in blister fluid samples. In conclusion, there were some common catechin metabolites in the plasma and blister fluid, and the concentration was always higher in plasma. The results suggest that green tea catechins and metabolites are bioavailable in skin and provide a novel link between catechin metabolites derived from the skin and gut microbiota.},

In this study we have investigated the effects of topical application of {EGCG}, the major polyphenol present in green tea, to human skin before {UV} irradiation on {UV}-induced markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymes. Using immunohistochemistry and analytical enzyme assays, we found that application of {EGCG} (mg/cm(2) skin) before a single {UV} exposure of 4x minimal erythema dose ({MED}) markedly decreases {UV}-induced production of hydrogen peroxide (68-90\%, P {\textless} 0.025-0.005) and nitric oxide (30-100\%, P {\textless} 0.025-0.005) in both epidermis and dermis in a time-dependent manner. {EGCG} pretreatment also inhibits {UV}-induced infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes, particularly {CD}11b(+) cells (a surface marker of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils), into the skin, which are considered to be the major producers of reactive oxygen species. {EGCG} treatment was also found to inhibit {UV}-induced epidermal lipid peroxidation at each time point studied (41-84\%, P {\textless} 0.05). A single {UV} exposure of 4x {MED} to human skin was found to increase catalase activity (109-145\%) and decrease glutathione peroxidase ({GPx}) activity (36-54\%) and total glutathione ({GSH}) level (13-36\%) at different time points studied. Pretreatment with {EGCG} was found to restore the {UV}-induced decrease in {GSH} level and afforded protection to the antioxidant enzyme {GPx}. Further studies are warranted to study the preventive effects of {EGCG} against multiple exposures to {UV} light of human skin.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation-induced infiltrating leukocytes, depletion of antigen-presenting cells, and oxidative stress in the skin play an important role in the induction of immune suppression and photocarcinogenesis. Earlier we have shown that topical application of polyphenols from green tea or its major chemopreventive constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}) prevents {UV}-B-induced immunosuppression in mice. To define the mechanism of prevention, we found that topical application of {EGCG} (3 mg/mouse/3 cm(2) of skin area) to C3H/{HeN} mice before a single dose of {UV}-B (90 {mJ}/cm(2)) exposure inhibited {UV}-B-induced infiltration of leukocytes, specifically the {CD}11b+ cell type, and myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of tissue infiltration of leukocytes. {EGCG} treatment was also found to prevent {UV}-B-induced depletion in the number of antigen-presenting cells when immunohistochemically detected as class {II} {MHC}+ Ia+ cells. {UV}-B-induced infiltrating cell production of H2O2 and nitric oxide ({NO}) was determined as a marker of oxidative stress. We found that pretreatment of {EGCG} decreased the number of {UV}-B-induced increases in H2O2-producing cells and inducible nitric oxide synthase-expressing cells and the production of H2O2 and {NO} in both epidermis and dermis at a {UV}-B-irradiated site. Together, these data suggest that prevention of {UV}-B-induced infiltrating leukocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and oxidative stress by {EGCG} treatment of mouse skin may be associated with the prevention of {UV}-B-induced immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Synopsis The efficacy of ellagic acid ({EA}), one of the naturally occurring polyphenols, in inhibiting melanogenesis was examined in vitro and in vivo. When mushroom-derived tyrosinase, a metaloprotein containing copper, was incubated with {EA}, enzymatic activity tended to decrease with decreasing copper concentration. Enzyme activity partially recovered when copper was added to the inactivated enzyme. Tyrosinase activity in the B16 melanoma cells was observed to recover in a dose-dependent manner when copper ions were added to the medium containing {EA}. Based on these results, {EA} is thought to react specifically with the copper located at the active centre of the tyrosinase molecule. Furthermore, when {EA} was applied for 6 weeks to brownish guinea-pigs, which have melanocytes in their skin, at the same time as irradiating for 2 weeks with ultra-violet light, skin pigmentation was clearly suppressed and the skin to which {EA} had been applied showed features similar to that of non-irradiated skin. These areas were irradiated again when the application of {EA} had been completed, and skin pigmentation occurred at the former site of {EA} application. In similar studies with hydroquinone, re-pigmentation did not occur on the sites at which hydroquinone (1\%) had been applied. Based on the results reported here, {EA} is thought to suppress melanogenesis by reacting with activated melanocytes and without injuring cells. Résumé Le pouvoir inhibiteur de la melanogenese par l’acide élagique ({AE}), un polyphénol naturel, a étéétudiéin vitro et in vivo. Nous avons fait incuber avec l’{AE} la tyrosinase extraite de champignons. C’est une métallo-protéine contenant du cuivre dont l’activité enzymatique tend à diminuer proportionnellement à la diminution de concentration en cuivre. Mais l’activité enzymatique se restaure partiellement, lorsque du cuivre est ajouté au milieu. Par ailleurs, l’activité de la tyrosinase dans des cellules de mélanome B16 s’exprime de façon dependante des ions cuivre ajoutés au milieu contenant l’{AE}. Sur la base de ces résultats, on peut penser que l’{AE} réagit de manière spécifique vis à vis du cuivre situé au centre actif de la molécule de tyrosinase. De plus, l’{AE} a été appliqué sur la peau de cochons d’Inde bruns durant 6 semaines. Ces animaux possèdent des mélanocytes cutanés, et suite à irradition simultanée aux {UV} pendant 2 semaines, la pigmentation cutanée disparait clairement. La peau sur laquelle on a appliqué l’{AE} montre des caractères similaires à ceux de la peau non-irradiée. Lorsque ces surfaces furent irradiées à leur tour en fin de période d’application, on observa la re-pigmentation de la peau à l’endroit de l’application de l’{AE}. Par des experiénces comparables avec de l’hydroquinone, le phénomène de re-pigmentation aux points d’application d’hydroquinone (en solution a 1\%) n’a pas été observé. A la base de ces résultats, on peut penser que l’{AE} inhibe la mélanogénèse par réaction avec les mélanocytes activés, sans endommager les cellules.},

Because psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by a hyperproliferative activity of keratinocytes and an inflammatory infiltrate, in the present study {IL}-6 production of monocytes and keratinocytes of patients with psoriasis was investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}) derived from psoriatics, atopics, and healthy controls were incubated for 24 h and, subsequently, supernatant {IL}-6 activity was measured using an {IL}-6-dependent hybridoma cell line (B9). Compared to controls and atopics, {PBMC} of psoriatics produced significantly increased amounts of biologically active {IL}-6. These findings were also confirmed by Western blot analysis using a specific antiserum directed against {IL}-6. Moreover, when the sera of the same patients were tested for {IL}-6 activity, sera of psoriatics contained significantly elevated amounts of circulating {IL}-6 in comparison to samples from atopics and healthy controls. In contrast to normal or uninvolved skin, keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions were remarkably positive for {IL}-6 as detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In addition, {IL}-6 also was found to induce its own synthesis and release by monocytes. These findings indicate that keratinocytes and monocytes in psoriasis are activated to produce increased amounts of {IL}-6, which may be one of the mediators involved in the regulation of both local and systemic inflammatory reactions occurring in skin diseases such as psoriasis.},

Therefore, this study was designed to investigate anti-inflammatory effects of (-)-α-bisabolol and its mechanisms of action. In this study, we found that (-)-α-bisabolol inhibited lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced production of nitric oxide ({NO}) and prostaglandin E(2) ({PGE}(2)) in {RAW}264.7 cells. In addition, expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ({COX}-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase ({iNOS}) genes was reduced, as evidenced by Western blot and luciferase reporter assays for {COX}-2 and {iNOS}. To assess the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory property of (-)-α-bisabolol, its effects on the activity of {AP}-1 and {NF}-κB promoters were examined. {LPS}-induced activation of {AP}-1 and {NF}-κB promoters was significantly reduced by (-)-α-bisabolol. Consistently, (-)-α-bisabolol reduced {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of {IκBα}. In addition, while {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of {ERK} and p38 was attenuated by (-)-α-bisabolol, significant changes in the level of phosphorylated {JNK} were not observed. Our results indicate that (-)-α-bisabolol exerts anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating expression of {iNOS} and {COX}-2 genes through inhibition of {NF}-κB and {AP}-1 ({ERK} and p38) signaling.},

{OBJECTIVE}: Our purpose was to investigate alterations in the production and morphology of collagen fibers brought about by long-term sun exposure.
{METHODS}: We compared collagen and collagenase gene expression and collagen immunohistochemical staining and used confocal laser scanning microscopy for morphologic examination of dermal collagen fibers in photodamaged compared with sun-protected skin from the same persons.
{RESULTS}: Despite a large increase in elastin messenger {RNA} in sun-damaged skin, collagen and collagenase gene expression remained essentially unchanged. However, striking alterations in the papillary dermis of photoaged skin were found, which revealed large, abnormally clumped elastic fibers and deformed collagen fibers of various diameters, replacing the normal architecture of the papillary dermis.
{CONCLUSION}: Our data provide evidence for normal collagen gene expression in sun-damaged skin and suggest that degradation and remodeling of collagen take place in the papillary dermis accompanied by deposition of other matrix components, predominantly abnormal elastic fibers.},

During this journey, keratinocytes undergo a series of biochemical and morphological changes that result in the formation of the various layers of the epidermis. Eventually, these cells turn into the outermost layer of dead cornified cells that are sloughed into the environment.

In this review the overall effects of oxidative stress are discussed as well as the sources of {ROS} including the mitochondrial {ETC}, peroxisomal and {ER} localized proteins, the Fenton reaction, and such enzymes as cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, xanthine oxidases, and {NADPH} oxidases. Furthermore, the defense mechanisms against oxidative stress ranging from enzymes like superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxiredoxins, and {GSH} peroxidases to organic compounds such as L-ascorbate, α-tocopherol, beta-carotene, uric acid, {CoQ}10, and glutathione are described in more detail. In addition the oxidative stress induced modifications caused to proteins, lipids and {DNA} are discussed. Finally age-related changes of the skin are also a topic of this review. They include a disruption of the epidermal calcium gradient in old skin with an accompanying change in the composition of the cornified envelope. This modified cornified envelope also leads to an altered anti-oxidative capacity and a reduced barrier function of the epidermis.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Green tea and green tea polyphenols have been shown to possess cancer preventive activities in preclinical model systems. In preparation for future green tea intervention trials, we have conducted a clinical study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of green tea polyphenols after 4 weeks of daily p.o. administration of epigallocatechin gallate ({EGCG}) or Polyphenon E (a defined, decaffeinated green tea polyphenol mixture). In an exploratory fashion, we have also determined the effect of chronic green tea polyphenol administration on {UV}-induced erythema response.Experimental Design: Healthy participants with Fitzpatric skin type {II} or {III} underwent a 2-week run-in period and were randomly assigned to receive one of the five treatments for 4 weeks: 800 mg {EGCG} once/day, 400 mg {EGCG} twice/day, 800 mg {EGCG} as Polyphenon E once/day, 400 mg {EGCG} as Polyphenon E twice/day, or a placebo once/day (8 subjects/group). Samples were collected and measurements performed before and after the 4-week treatment period for determination of safety, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity of green tea polyphenol treatment.Results: Adverse events reported during the 4-week treatment period include excess gas, upset stomach, nausea, heartburn, stomach ache, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, and muscle pain. All of the reported events were rated as mild events. For most events, the incidence reported in the polyphenol-treated groups was not more than that reported in the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in blood counts and blood chemistry profiles after repeated administration of green tea polyphenol products. There was a \&gt;60\% increase in the area under the plasma {EGCG} concentration-time curve after 4 weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at a dosing schedule of 800 mg once daily. No significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of {EGCG} after repeated green tea polyphenol treatment at a regimen of 400 mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetics of the conjugated metabolites of epigallocatechin and epicatechin were not affected by repeated green tea polyphenol treatment. Four weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at the selected dose and dosing schedule did not provide protection against {UV}-induced erythema.Conclusions: We conclude that it is safe for healthy individuals to take green tea polyphenol products in amounts equivalent to the {EGCG} content in 8–16 cups of green tea once a day or in divided doses twice a day for 4 weeks. There is a \&gt;60\% increase in the systemic availability of free {EGCG} after chronic green tea polyphenol administration at a high daily bolus dose (800 mg {EGCG} or Polyphenon E once daily).},

	abstract = {Identification of natural products capable of affording protection against {UVB} radiation-induced inflammatory responses and generation of oxidative stress may have important human health implications. The {UVB} exposure-induced skin injury and oxidative stress has been associated with a variety of skin disease conditions including photoaging, inflammation and cancer. Tea is a popular beverage consumed worldwide. In several mouse skin models, topical application as well as oral consumption of green tea has been shown to afford protection against chemical and {UVB}-induced carcinogenesis and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we investigated in human skin, whether topical application of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}), the major polyphenolic constituent in green tea, inhibits {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes (macrophage/neutrophils), a potential source of generation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}), and generation of prostaglandin ({PG}) metabolites. Human subjects were {UVB} irradiated on sun-protected skin to four times their minimal erythema dosage ({MED}) and skin biopsies or keratomes were obtained either 24 h or 48 h later. We found that topical application of {EGCG} (3 mg/2.5 cm2) before {UVB} (4 {MED}) exposure to human skin significantly blocked {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes and reduced myeloperoxidase activity. These infiltrating leukocytes are considered to be the major source of generation of {ROS}. In the same set of experiments we found that topical application of {EGCG} before {UVB} exposure decreased {UVB}-induced erythema. In additional experiments, we found that microsomes from {EGCG} pretreated human skin and exposed to {UVB}, compared to {UVB} exposure alone, produced significantly reduced {PG} metabolites, particularly {PGE}2. The {PG} metabolites play a critical role in free radical generation and skin tumor promotion in multistage skin carcinogenesis. Careful microscopic examination of skin sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, under higher magnification (x400) also revealed that {EGCG} pretreated and {UVB}-exposed human skin contained fewer dead cells in the epidermis with comparison to nonpretreated {UVB}-exposed skin. Taken together, our data demonstrate that {EGCG} has the potential to block the {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes and the subsequent generation of {ROS} in human skin. This may explain the possible mechanism involved in anti-inflammatory effects of green tea. We suggest that {EGCG} may be useful as a topical agent for protection against {UVB}-induced {ROS}-associated inflammatory dermatoses, photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. Further studies are warranted in this direction.},

Psychophysiologic disorders (e.g., psoriasis and eczema) are associated with skin problems that are not directly connected to the mind but that react to emotional states, such as stress. Primary psychiatric disorders involve psychiatric conditions that result in self-induced cutaneous manifestations, such as trichotillomania and delusions of parasitosis. Secondary psychiatric disorders are associated with disfiguring skin disorders. The disfigurement results in psychologic problems, such as decreased self-esteem, depression or social phobia. Most psychodermatologic disorders can be treated with anxiety-decreasing techniques or, in extreme cases, psychotropic medications.},

              Background and Objective
              Deep coagulation of skin collagen by Er:{YAG} laser repetitive pulses has been predicted by previous theoretical models and later demonstrated on animal skin. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of repetitive Er:{YAG} laser pulses on human skin and its response to this treatment.
            
            
              Study Design/Materials and Methods
              
                Lid skin of six female volunteers with blepharochalasis has been treated with laser at day 0, 7, and 21 before elective surgery—blepharoplasty. The treated skin was excised as part of the procedure and prepared for further histological examination. We used a 2,940 nm Er:{YAG} laser (Fidelis M320A by Fotona) with ‘smooth’ mode parameters: fluence from 0.50 to 2.00 J/cm
                2
                ; six pulses per packet; 550 μsecond/pulse, 250 millisecond/packet; single pass, no overlapping; spot size 5 mm; repetition rate 20 Hz.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                We observed deep collagen denaturation at laser fluences of 1.25 J/cm
                2
                and over; epidermal damage was proportional to fluence with total coagulation of the epidermal layer at fluences of 1.75 J/cm
                2
                and over. At day 7 after laser treatment we observed a complete regeneration of the epidermal layer and a regeneration zone within the dermis with prominent infiltration of {CD}68+ monocytes/macrophages. At day 21 after laser treatment we observed collagen remodeling and (myo‐)fibroblast proliferation at tissue depths of up to 240 μm.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Repetitive Er:{YAG} laser irradiation is effective in deep denaturation and remodeling of human skin collagen in vivo, with less epidermal damage compared to standard Er:{YAG} laser skin resurfacing. Lasers Surg. Med. 35:146–151, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

A total of 31 healthy subjects were randomized into two groups: subjects in the stress group underwent a stress-inducing protocol and those in the control group were exposed to indifferent conditions. Subsequently, topical capsaicin cream was administered on the non-dominant anterior forearm of each subject from the two groups. The assessment of the local inflammatory reaction induced by capsaicin was performed by thermography at 25 and 40 min post-application. In both groups the inflammatory reaction induced by capsaicin was evidenced at 25 min and was maintained at 40 min post-application. However, at 40 min post-application the hyperthermal area was larger in subjects from the stress group, suggesting that stress exposure is associated with an amplification of the mechanisms involved in capsaicin-induced skin neurogenic inflammation.},

Intrinsic aging is associated with programmed aging and cellular senescence, which are caused by endogenous oxidative stress and cellular damage. Extrinsic aging is the result of environmental factors, such as ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation and pollution, and leads to the production of reactive oxygen species, ultimately causing {DNA} damage and cellular dysfunction. In aged skin, senescent cells accumulate and contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, which further contributes to the aging process. To combat the symptoms of aging, various topical agents and clinical procedures such as chemical peels, injectables, and energy-based devices have been developed. These procedures address different symptoms of aging, but to devise an effective anti-aging treatment protocol, it is essential to thoroughly understand the mechanisms of skin aging.

	abstract = {Significance: The skin is a complex and dynamic organ that performs several vital functions. The maturation process of the skin starts at birth with the adaption of the skin to the comparatively dry environment compared to the in utero milieu. This adaptive flexibility results in the unique properties of infant skin. To deliver appropriate care to infant skin, it is necessary to understand that it is evolving with unique characteristics., Recent Advances: The role of biophysical noninvasive techniques in the assessment of skin development underlines the importance of an objective evaluation of skin physiology parameters. Skin hydration, transepidermal water loss, and {pH} values are measurable with specific instruments that give us an accurate and reproducible assessment during infant skin maturation. The recording of these values, following standard measurement procedures, allows us to evaluate the integrity of the skin barrier and to monitor the functionality of the maturing skin over time., Critical Issues: During the barrier development, impaired skin function makes the skin vulnerable to chemical damage, microbial infections, and skin diseases, possibly compromising the general health of the infant. Preterm newborns, during the first weeks of life, have an even less developed skin barrier and, therefore, are even more at risk. Thus, it is extremely important to evaluate the risk of infection, skin breakdown, topical agent absorption, and the risk of thermoregulation failure., Future Directions: Detailed and objective evaluations of infant skin maturation are necessary to improve infant skin care. The results of these evaluations should be formed into general protocols that will allow doctors and caregivers to give more personalized care to full-term newborns, preterm newborns, and infants.},

	abstract = {This review analyses whether skin temperature represents ambient temperature and serves as a feedforward signal for the thermoregulation system, or whether it is one of the body's temperatures and provides feedback. The body is covered mostly by hairy (non‐glabrous) skin, which is typically insulated from the environment (with clothes in humans and with fur in non‐human mammals). Thermal signals from hairy skin represent a temperature of the insulated superficial layer of the body and provide feedback to the thermoregulation system. It is explained that this feedback is auxiliary, both negative and positive, and that it reduces the system's response time and load error. Non‐hairy (glabrous) skin covers specialized heat‐exchange organs (e.g. the hand), which are also used to explore the environment. In thermoregulation, these organs are primarily effectors. Their main thermosensory‐related role is to assess local temperatures of objects explored; these local temperatures are feedforward signals for various behaviours. Non‐hairy skin also contributes to the feedback for thermoregulation, but this contribution is limited. Autonomic (physiological) thermoregulation does not use feedforward signals. Thermoregulatory behaviours use both feedback and feedforward signals. Implications of these principles to thermopharmacology, a new approach to achieving biological effects by blocking temperature signals with drugs, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The skin is the largest organ in the body and plays several essential functions acting as a barrier that protects us from physical and chemical insults, prevents the entrance of pathogens and the loss of water, besides playing an esential role in the regulation of body temperature. The skin displays a high regenerative capacity, evidenced by its self-renewing activity and the process of wound healing, driven by the existence of several resident stem cell populations. Due to the high prevalence of skin pathology, and their anatomical accessibility, skin biopsies and their subsequent microscopic observation constitute a powerfull tool for the study of primary skin diseases, as well as cutaneous manifestations of systemic diseases. This gave rise to dermatopathology as a specific discipline that unifies dermatology and pathology. In this setting, staining with hematoxylin and eosin constitutes the gold standard method for microscopic observation and diagnosis. Yet, several additional stains are used for specific purposes, such as trichrome stains for the staining of collagens in the extracellular matrix. We have applied a recently developed stain ({RGB} trichrome, acronym for picrosirius Red, fast Green and alcian Blue) to human samples to assess the staining outcomes in normal skin tissues. {RGB} staining provides a high contrasted interface between epidermis and dermis, and a comprehensible staining of the different dermal structures such as blood vessels, nerves, and sweat and sebaceous glands. The specific staining of collagens by picrosirius red can be useful for the objective quantification of these proteins under polarized light microscopy. In hair follicles, {RGB} staining resulted in specific staining of the epidermal sheaths and the encasing connective tissue (i.e., dermal sheath). Interestingly, the dermal sheath show two domains in which blue predominates over red staining, thus indicating that proteoglycans prevail in these areas. These two zones are the dermal papilla and an uncharacterized zone located at the upper isthmus, that we have denominated as proteoglycan-enriched belt ({PEB}). While the role of the papilla in the induction and regulation of hair growth is clearly established, the possible role of {PEB} remains to be determined and merits additional investigation.},

Topical applications of basic skin care products seem to reduce skin tear incidence. The suction blister method leads to the artificial and controlled separation of dermis and epidermis. Therefore, time to blister formation may be used as outcome measuring the strength of dermo‐epidermal adhesion. We conducted an exploratory, randomised, controlled trial with a split‐body design on forearms in healthy female subjects (n = 12; mean age 70.3 [{SD} 2.1] years). Forearms assigned to the intervention were treated twice daily with petrolatum for 8 weeks. Suction blisters were induced on forearms after 4 and 8 weeks and time to blister formation was measured. Stratum corneum and epidermal hydration were measured and epidermal thickness was assessed via optical coherence tomography. Time to blistering was longer and stratum corneum as well as epidermal hydration was consistently higher in intervention skin areas. We conclude that topical application of basic skin care products may improve mechanical adhesion of the dermo‐epidermal junction and that the parameter “time to blistering” is a suitable outcome to measure dermo‐epidermal adhesion strength in clinical research.},

	abstract = {The time at which human diploid cell strains can be expected to cease dividing in vitro (Phase {III}) is not a function of the number of subcultivations but rather of the number of potential cell doublings. Each clonable cell within the population is endowed with the same doubling potential (50 ±10). Cells of the same strain, but with different “doubling potentials”, were mixed. Phase {III} in such mixed populations occurs at that time when the “youngest” cell component is expected to reach Phase {III}. The “older” component has no effect on the time at which Phase {III} is expected to take place in the “younger” component. An ancillary conclusion that Phase {III} cannot be explained by the presence of a latent virus, mycoplasma or media composition is confirmed. Human diploid cell strains derived from adult lung have a significantly lower doubling potential in vitro than do fetal strains. The Phase {III} phenomenon may be related to senescence in vivo. The cellular theory of aging must be related to normal cells in vitro and not to heteroploid cell lines. The former have a finite period of multiplication; the latter are indefinitely cultivable. In vivo experiments also indicate that transplanted normal tissue has a finite lifetime. Chromosome anomalies occurring in Phase {III} may be related to such anomalies occurring in the cells of older animals, including man. The survival curves obtained with human diploid cell strains are comparable to “multiple-hit” or “multiple-target” curves obtained with other biological systems where an initial threshold dose is required before an exponential form of the curve is established. Whatever cell component(s) may be involved in the finite lifetime of human diploid cell strains, the ultimate accumulation of nondividing cells could be the result of accumulated damage to a single cellular target or to inactivation of many targets.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of damage is generally considered the cause of aging. Interventions that delay aging mobilize mechanisms that protect and repair cellular components. Consequently, research has been focused on studying the protective and homeostatic mechanisms within cells. However, in humans and other multicellular organisms, cells are surrounded by extracellular matrices ({ECMs}), which are important for tissue structure, function, and intercellular communication. During aging, components of the {ECM} become damaged through fragmentation, glycation, crosslinking, and accumulation of protein aggregation, all of which contribute to age-related pathologies. Interestingly, placing senescent cells into a young {ECM} rejuvenates them. Furthermore, we found that many longevity-assurances pathways reactivate de novo synthesis of {ECM} proteins during aging. This raises the question of what constitutes a young {ECM} to reverse aging or maintain health? In order to make inroads to answering this question, I suggest a systems-level approach of quantifying the matrisome or {ECM} compositions reflecting health, pathology, or phenotype and propose a novel term, the "matreotype," to describe this. The matreotype is defined as the composition and modification of {ECM} or matrisome proteins associated with or caused by a phenotype, such as longevity, or a distinct and acute physiological state, as observed during aging or disease. Every cell type produces its unique {ECM}. Intriguingly, cancer-cell types can even be identified based on their unique {ECM} composition. Thus, the matreotype reflects cellular identity and physiological status. Defined matreotypes could be used as biomarkers or prognostic factors for disease or health status during aging with potential relevance for personalized medicine. Treatment with biologics that alter {ECM}-to-cell mechanotransduction might be a strategy to reverse age-associated pathologies. An understanding of how to reverse from an old to a young matreotype might point toward novel strategies to rejuvenate cells and help maintain tissue homeostasis to promote health during aging.},

Besides, many epidemiological studies have shown a lower incidence for skin cancer in individuals with darker skin compared to those with fair skin. Skin pigmentation is of great cultural and cosmetic importance, yet the role of melanin in photoprotection is still controversial.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To assess individual time-related (time-stamped) {UV} radiation ({UVR}) dose pattern and sun exposure behavior.
{DESIGN}: Open prospective observational study.
{SETTING}: University hospital. Study Subjects Two hundred eighty-five Danish volunteers with apparently healthy skin: children, adolescents, indoor workers, sun worshippers, golfers, and gardeners (age range, 4-68 years). Measurements We developed a personal electronic {UVR} dosimeter in a wristwatch ({SunSaver}) and measured continuously time-related {UVR} doses in standard erythema dose ({SED}) and corresponding sun exposure behavior from diaries, resulting in 346 sun-years (median, 119 days). The estimated yearly {UVR} doses were calculated based on personal and ambient measured doses.
{RESULTS}: The median estimated yearly {UVR} dose was 173 {SEDs} (range, 132 {SEDs} [indoor workers]-224 {SEDs} [gardeners]), with no significant difference by age (P =.25) or sex (P =.75). The {SED} of girls (175 {SEDs}) was significantly (P =.04) higher than that of boys (116 {SEDs}). Subjects younger than 20 years had an increase of 5 {SEDs} per year (P =.03). Sunbathing or exposing shoulders (risk behavior) outside the beach resulted in a median of 2.5 {SEDs} per day in northern Europe and 3.2 {SEDs} per day in southern Europe; however, at the beach, corresponding values were 4.6 and 6.9 {SEDs} per day. Children and adolescents received more than half their total {UVR} dose at the beach. Sunburning doses above 10 {SEDs} per day were connected with sunbathing or exposing shoulders. Of the {UVR} dose, 50\% was received between noon and 3 {PM}. Only the gardeners received most of their {UVR} dose (55\%) on working days.
{CONCLUSIONS}: High {UVR} doses are connected with risk behavior, except for outdoor workers. There is no need to change sun exposure habits on days without risk behavior.},

	volume = {16},
	issn = {1107-3756},
	abstract = {Ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation from the sun is widely considered as a major cause of human skin photoaging and skin cancer. {UV} radiation-induced proinflammatory cytokines mediated by {NF}-{kappaB} reportedly play important roles in photoaging and cancer. {NF}-{kappaB} and cytokines have been thus perceived as molecular targets for pharmacological intervention. With an increasing amount of knowledge of the actions of green tea extracts at cellular and molecular levels, the beneficial effect of drinking green tea has become well recognized if not completely accepted. The components in green tea have even been added to skin-care products unregulated, while the molecular mechanisms of the actions of those components on human skin are being unraveled. Using cultured human keratinocytes, we investigated the effects of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}), a major polyphenolic constituent in green tea, on {UV}-induced activation of transcription factor {NF}-{kappaB} and proinflammatory pathway by measuring nuclear translocation of {NF}-{kappaB} and {IL}-6 secretion in vitro. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis and {ELISA} indicated that both nuclear p65 and secreted {IL}-6 were significantly (p{\textless}0.05) induced by {UVB} (20, 30 {mJ}/cm2) and {UVA} irradiation (10, 20 J/cm2). {NF}-{kappaB} nuclear translocation and {IL}-6 secretion induced by {UVB} and {UVA} were dramatically inhibited by treatment of {EGCG}. {FACS} analysis showed that {EGCG} also inhibited {UVB}-induced apoptosis. {EGCG} recovered {UV}-induced loss of anti-apoptotic component, bcl-2, and inhibited {UV}-induced apoptotic component, Fas ligand, expression. Collectively, we conclude that {EGCG} inhibits {UVB}- and {UVA}-induced proinflammatory pathway and inhibits apoptosis in cultured human keratinocytes in vitro. Our data suggest that {EGCG} be added to cosmetic or skin-care products for prevention from {UV}-induced skin photoaging if this activity can be further confirmed and no cytotoxicity is reported in human skin in vivo.},
