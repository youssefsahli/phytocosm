              α
              ‐Bisabolol is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene alcohol which was first isolated from
              Matricaria chamomilla
              (Asteraceae) in the twentieth century and has since been identified in other aromatic plants such as
              Eremanthus erythropappus
              ,
              Smyrniopsis aucheri
              and
              Vanillosmopsis
              species. Recently,
              α
              ‐bisabolol was identified as a major constituent of
              Salvia runcinata
              essential oil, a plant indigenous to South Africa. The use of
              α
              ‐bisabolol or bisabolol‐rich oil as an anti‐inflammatory agent is ubiquitous. This compound also exhibits several other pharmacological properties such as analgesic, antibiotic and anticancer activities. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity of bisabolol have also been investigated. Due to the low toxicity associated with bisabolol the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) has granted this constituent with Generally Regarded as Safe ({GRAS}) status which has promoted its use as an active ingredient in several commercial products. This review aims to summarise the role of
              α
              ‐bisabolol in pharmacological and/or physiological processes and to discuss some of the possible mechanisms of action of this commercially important molecule.},

In in vivo situations, polyphenolic anthranoids are extensively broken down into glucuronides and sulfate metabolites by the gut and the liver. The anti-inflammatory potential of aloe metabolites has not been examined. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of aloe metabolites from in vitro (lipopolysaccharides ({LPS})-activated {RAW}264.7 macrophages) and ex vivo ({LPS}-activated peritoneal macrophages) to in vivo ({LPS}-induced septic mice). The production of proinflammatory cytokines ({TNF}-

α
α
, {IL}-12, and {NO}, and suppressed the phosphorylation of {MAPKs} by {LPS}-activated {RAW}264.7 macrophages. In addition, aloe metabolites reduced the production of {NO}, {TNF}-
α
α
 and {IL}-12 by murine peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, aloe administration significantly reduced the {NO} level and exhibited protective effects against sepsis-related death in {LPS}-induced septic mice. These results suggest that aloe metabolites exerted anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, and that these effects were associated with the inhibition of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, aloe could be considered an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of sepsis.},

Using kinase profiling, we identified Hck, Blk and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) as targets of bakuchiol, which directly bound to each kinase in an {ATP}-competitive manner. Bakuchiol also inhibited {EGF}-induced signaling pathways downstream of Hck, Blk and p38 {MAPK}, including the {MEK}/{ERKs}, p38 {MAPK}/{MSK}1 and {AKT}/p70S6K pathways.

              Objective
              The study was undertaken to compare the skin care related activities of retinol and bakuchiol, a potential alternative to retinoids. Retinol is a pivotal regulator of differentiation and growth of developing as well as adult skin. Retinoic acid is the major physiologically active metabolite of retinol regulating gene expression through retinoic acid receptor – dependant and independent pathways.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Comparative gene expression profiling of both substances in the {EpiDerm}
                {FT}
                full thickness skin substitute model was undertaken. Furthermore, type I, {III} and {IV} collagen, as well as aquaporin 3 expression was analyzed by {ELISA} and/or histochemistry in human dermal fibroblasts and/or Epiderm {FT} skin substitutes.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Bakuchiol is a meroterpene phenol abundant in seeds and leaves of the plant
                Psoralea corylifolia
                . We present evidence that bakuchiol, having no structural resemblance to retinoids, can function as a functional analogue of retinol. Volcano plots showed great overall similarity of retinol and bakuchiol effects on the gene expression profile. This similarity was confirmed by the side‐by‐side comparison of the modulation of individual genes, as well as on the protein level by {ELISA} and histochemistry. Retinol‐like functionality was further confirmed for the upregulation of types I and
                {IV}

                {III}
                collagen in the mature fibroblast model. Bakuchiol was also formulated into a finished skin care product and was tested in clinical case study by twice‐a‐day facial application. The results showed that, after 12 weeks treatment, significant improvement in lines and wrinkles, pigmentation, elasticity, firmness and overall reduction in photo‐damage was observed, without usual retinol therapy‐associated undesirable effects.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Based on these data, we propose that bakuchiol can function as an anti‐ageing compound through retinol‐like regulation of gene expression.

            Résumé
            
              Objectif
              L'étude a été menée pour comparer les activités liées aux soins de la peau du rétinol et du bakuchiol, une alternative potentielle aux rétinoïdes. Le rétinol est un régulateur essentiel de la différenciation et de la croissance de la peau en développement ainsi que la peau des adultes. L'acide rétinoïque est le principal métabolite physiologiquement actif du rétinol qui régule l'expression des gènes par des voies dépendantes et indépendantes du récepteur de l'acide rétinoïque.
            
            
              Méthodes
              
                Un profilage comparatif d'expression génétique de ces deux substances dans le modèle substitut de la peau {EpiDerm}
                {FT}
                a été entrepris. La synthèse des collagènes de type I,
                {III}
                et
                {IV}
                et de l'aquaporine 3 dans des fibroblastes dermiques humains normaux ont été analysés par
                {ELISA}
                et/ou en histochimie dans le modèle de peau {EpiDerm}
                {TM} {FT}
                .
              
            
            
              Résultats
              
                Bakuchiol est un phénol meroterpène abondant dans les graines et les feuilles de la
                Psoralea corylifolia
                . Nous présentons des preuves que bakuchiol, n'ayant aucune ressemblance structurelle avec les rétinoïdes, peut fonctionner comme un analogue fonctionnel de rétinol. Les diagrammes de type Volcano montrent la grande similitude de l'effet du rétinol et du bakuchiol sur l'expression des gènes. Cette ressemblance a été aussi démontrée par la comparaison de la modulation de l'expression de gènes particulaires, appartenant a de différentes groupes fonctionnelles. La fonctionnalité rétinol ‐like a été confirmée par la régulation à la hausse du collagène de type I et
                {IV}
                et aquaporine 3 au niveau de proteines par {ELISA} et histochimie. Le bakuchiol a également été formulé dans un produit de soin de la peau et a été testé dans une étude clinique avec deux applications par jour au visage. Les résultats ont montré que, après le traitement de douze semaines, une amélioration significative a été observée dans les rides et ridules, la pigmentation, l'élasticité, la fermeté et la réduction globale des dommages du photo‐vieillissement, sans les effets indésirables habituels associés à la thérapie au rétinol.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Sur la base de ces données, nous proposons que le bakuchiol peut fonctionner comme un composé anti‐ vieillissement grâce à la réglementation de l'expression des gènes similaire au rétinol.},

Here, we investigated the potential protective role of barbaloin in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced acute lung injury ({ALI}) and clarified the underlying mechanism in vitro. Histological analysis showed that barbaloin exhibited a certain protective effect on {LPS}-induced {ALI}. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the actions of barbaloin, {LPS}-stimulated macrophages were used in this study. The results showed that barbaloin decreased the phosphorylation levels of {IκBα} and {NF}-κB p65, leading to a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ({TNF}-α, {IL}-1β and {IL}-6). Furthermore, barbaloin also reduced the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) similarly to the antioxidant N‑acetyl‑l‑cysteine ({NAC}), which alone repressed the {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase ({PI}3K) and {AKT}. Additionally, a pharmacological inhibitor of {PI}3K/{AKT}, {LY}294002, also restrained the phosphorylation levels of {IκBα} and {NF}-κB p65 and thereby decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, these results show that barbaloin possesses a protective effect on {LPS}-induced {ALI} via suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the {ROS}-mediated {PI}3K/{AKT}/{NF}-κB pathway.},

The role of growth factors, cytokines, hormones and other molecular mediators in these processes is examined. Specially for women, decrease of estrogen is determinant to alter signaling and to compromise skin structure, especially the dermis. Environmental factors, such as ultraviolet rays and pollution alongside the impact of ageing on signaling pathways, especially {TGF}-β and proteases (metalloproteinases and cathepsins). Furthermore, with advancing age, the skin's capacity to shelter microbiome challenges diminishes, leading to alterations in signal transduction and subsequent functional decline. Understanding these age-related changes is essential for developing targeted therapies aimed at enhancing skin health and resilience, but also offers a promising avenue for the treatment of skin disorders and the promotion of healthy ageing.},

	abstract = {Dietary flavonoids may protect against sunburn inflammation in skin. Preliminary reports using less complete analysis suggest that certain catechins and their metabolites are found in skin biopsies and blister fluid after consumption of green tea; however, it is not known if they are affected by solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) or whether conjugated forms, with consequently altered bioactivity, are present. The present study tested the hypothesis that {UVR} affects the catechin levels in the skin of healthy volunteers after consumption of green tea and how catechins in the plasma are related to their presence in skin tissue samples. In an open oral intervention study, 11 subjects consumed green tea and vitamin C supplements daily for 3months. Presupplementation and postsupplementation plasma samples, suction blister fluid and skin biopsies were collected; the latter two samples were collected both before and after {UVR}. A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric assay was used to measure the intact catechin metabolites, conjugates and free forms. Seven green tea catechins and their corresponding metabolites were identified postsupplementation in skin biopsies, 20 in blister fluid and 26 in plasma, with 15 green tea catechin metabolites present in both blister fluid and plasma. The valerolactone, O-methyl-M4-O-sulfate, a gut microbiota metabolite of catechins, was significantly increased 1.6-fold by {UVR} in blister fluid samples. In conclusion, there were some common catechin metabolites in the plasma and blister fluid, and the concentration was always higher in plasma. The results suggest that green tea catechins and metabolites are bioavailable in skin and provide a novel link between catechin metabolites derived from the skin and gut microbiota.},

The green tea constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}) is a potent antioxidant and has shown remarkable preventive effects against photocarcinogenesis and phototoxicity in mouse models. In this study we have investigated the effects of topical application of {EGCG}, the major polyphenol present in green tea, to human skin before {UV} irradiation on {UV}-induced markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymes. Using immunohistochemistry and analytical enzyme assays, we found that application of {EGCG} (mg/cm(2) skin) before a single {UV} exposure of 4x minimal erythema dose ({MED}) markedly decreases {UV}-induced production of hydrogen peroxide (68-90\%, P {\textless} 0.025-0.005) and nitric oxide (30-100\%, P {\textless} 0.025-0.005) in both epidermis and dermis in a time-dependent manner. {EGCG} pretreatment also inhibits {UV}-induced infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes, particularly {CD}11b(+) cells (a surface marker of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils), into the skin, which are considered to be the major producers of reactive oxygen species. {EGCG} treatment was also found to inhibit {UV}-induced epidermal lipid peroxidation at each time point studied (41-84\%, P {\textless} 0.05). A single {UV} exposure of 4x {MED} to human skin was found to increase catalase activity (109-145\%) and decrease glutathione peroxidase ({GPx}) activity (36-54\%) and total glutathione ({GSH}) level (13-36\%) at different time points studied. Pretreatment with {EGCG} was found to restore the {UV}-induced decrease in {GSH} level and afforded protection to the antioxidant enzyme {GPx}. Further studies are warranted to study the preventive effects of {EGCG} against multiple exposures to {UV} light of human skin.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation-induced infiltrating leukocytes, depletion of antigen-presenting cells, and oxidative stress in the skin play an important role in the induction of immune suppression and photocarcinogenesis. Earlier we have shown that topical application of polyphenols from green tea or its major chemopreventive constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}) prevents {UV}-B-induced immunosuppression in mice. To define the mechanism of prevention, we found that topical application of {EGCG} (3 mg/mouse/3 cm(2) of skin area) to C3H/{HeN} mice before a single dose of {UV}-B (90 {mJ}/cm(2)) exposure inhibited {UV}-B-induced infiltration of leukocytes, specifically the {CD}11b+ cell type, and myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of tissue infiltration of leukocytes. {EGCG} treatment was also found to prevent {UV}-B-induced depletion in the number of antigen-presenting cells when immunohistochemically detected as class {II} {MHC}+ Ia+ cells. {UV}-B-induced infiltrating cell production of H2O2 and nitric oxide ({NO}) was determined as a marker of oxidative stress. We found that pretreatment of {EGCG} decreased the number of {UV}-B-induced increases in H2O2-producing cells and inducible nitric oxide synthase-expressing cells and the production of H2O2 and {NO} in both epidermis and dermis at a {UV}-B-irradiated site. Together, these data suggest that prevention of {UV}-B-induced infiltrating leukocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and oxidative stress by {EGCG} treatment of mouse skin may be associated with the prevention of {UV}-B-induced immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Synopsis The efficacy of ellagic acid ({EA}), one of the naturally occurring polyphenols, in inhibiting melanogenesis was examined in vitro and in vivo. When mushroom-derived tyrosinase, a metaloprotein containing copper, was incubated with {EA}, enzymatic activity tended to decrease with decreasing copper concentration. Enzyme activity partially recovered when copper was added to the inactivated enzyme. Tyrosinase activity in the B16 melanoma cells was observed to recover in a dose-dependent manner when copper ions were added to the medium containing {EA}. Based on these results, {EA} is thought to react specifically with the copper located at the active centre of the tyrosinase molecule. Furthermore, when {EA} was applied for 6 weeks to brownish guinea-pigs, which have melanocytes in their skin, at the same time as irradiating for 2 weeks with ultra-violet light, skin pigmentation was clearly suppressed and the skin to which {EA} had been applied showed features similar to that of non-irradiated skin. These areas were irradiated again when the application of {EA} had been completed, and skin pigmentation occurred at the former site of {EA} application. In similar studies with hydroquinone, re-pigmentation did not occur on the sites at which hydroquinone (1\%) had been applied. Based on the results reported here, {EA} is thought to suppress melanogenesis by reacting with activated melanocytes and without injuring cells. Résumé Le pouvoir inhibiteur de la melanogenese par l’acide élagique ({AE}), un polyphénol naturel, a étéétudiéin vitro et in vivo. Nous avons fait incuber avec l’{AE} la tyrosinase extraite de champignons. C’est une métallo-protéine contenant du cuivre dont l’activité enzymatique tend à diminuer proportionnellement à la diminution de concentration en cuivre. Mais l’activité enzymatique se restaure partiellement, lorsque du cuivre est ajouté au milieu. Par ailleurs, l’activité de la tyrosinase dans des cellules de mélanome B16 s’exprime de façon dependante des ions cuivre ajoutés au milieu contenant l’{AE}. Sur la base de ces résultats, on peut penser que l’{AE} réagit de manière spécifique vis à vis du cuivre situé au centre actif de la molécule de tyrosinase. De plus, l’{AE} a été appliqué sur la peau de cochons d’Inde bruns durant 6 semaines. Ces animaux possèdent des mélanocytes cutanés, et suite à irradition simultanée aux {UV} pendant 2 semaines, la pigmentation cutanée disparait clairement. La peau sur laquelle on a appliqué l’{AE} montre des caractères similaires à ceux de la peau non-irradiée. Lorsque ces surfaces furent irradiées à leur tour en fin de période d’application, on observa la re-pigmentation de la peau à l’endroit de l’application de l’{AE}. Par des experiénces comparables avec de l’hydroquinone, le phénomène de re-pigmentation aux points d’application d’hydroquinone (en solution a 1\%) n’a pas été observé. A la base de ces résultats, on peut penser que l’{AE} inhibe la mélanogénèse par réaction avec les mélanocytes activés, sans endommager les cellules.},

	abstract = {Although (-)-α-bisabolol, a natural monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol, is often used as a cosmetic soothing supplement, little is known about its mechanisms of anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate anti-inflammatory effects of (-)-α-bisabolol and its mechanisms of action. In this study, we found that (-)-α-bisabolol inhibited lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced production of nitric oxide ({NO}) and prostaglandin E(2) ({PGE}(2)) in {RAW}264.7 cells. In addition, expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ({COX}-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase ({iNOS}) genes was reduced, as evidenced by Western blot and luciferase reporter assays for {COX}-2 and {iNOS}. To assess the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory property of (-)-α-bisabolol, its effects on the activity of {AP}-1 and {NF}-κB promoters were examined. {LPS}-induced activation of {AP}-1 and {NF}-κB promoters was significantly reduced by (-)-α-bisabolol. Consistently, (-)-α-bisabolol reduced {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of {IκBα}. In addition, while {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of {ERK} and p38 was attenuated by (-)-α-bisabolol, significant changes in the level of phosphorylated {JNK} were not observed. Our results indicate that (-)-α-bisabolol exerts anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating expression of {iNOS} and {COX}-2 genes through inhibition of {NF}-κB and {AP}-1 ({ERK} and p38) signaling.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Green tea and green tea polyphenols have been shown to possess cancer preventive activities in preclinical model systems. In preparation for future green tea intervention trials, we have conducted a clinical study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of green tea polyphenols after 4 weeks of daily p.o. administration of epigallocatechin gallate ({EGCG}) or Polyphenon E (a defined, decaffeinated green tea polyphenol mixture). In an exploratory fashion, we have also determined the effect of chronic green tea polyphenol administration on {UV}-induced erythema response.Experimental Design: Healthy participants with Fitzpatric skin type {II} or {III} underwent a 2-week run-in period and were randomly assigned to receive one of the five treatments for 4 weeks: 800 mg {EGCG} once/day, 400 mg {EGCG} twice/day, 800 mg {EGCG} as Polyphenon E once/day, 400 mg {EGCG} as Polyphenon E twice/day, or a placebo once/day (8 subjects/group). Samples were collected and measurements performed before and after the 4-week treatment period for determination of safety, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity of green tea polyphenol treatment.Results: Adverse events reported during the 4-week treatment period include excess gas, upset stomach, nausea, heartburn, stomach ache, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, and muscle pain. All of the reported events were rated as mild events. For most events, the incidence reported in the polyphenol-treated groups was not more than that reported in the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in blood counts and blood chemistry profiles after repeated administration of green tea polyphenol products. There was a \&gt;60\% increase in the area under the plasma {EGCG} concentration-time curve after 4 weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at a dosing schedule of 800 mg once daily. No significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of {EGCG} after repeated green tea polyphenol treatment at a regimen of 400 mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetics of the conjugated metabolites of epigallocatechin and epicatechin were not affected by repeated green tea polyphenol treatment. Four weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at the selected dose and dosing schedule did not provide protection against {UV}-induced erythema.Conclusions: We conclude that it is safe for healthy individuals to take green tea polyphenol products in amounts equivalent to the {EGCG} content in 8–16 cups of green tea once a day or in divided doses twice a day for 4 weeks. There is a \&gt;60\% increase in the systemic availability of free {EGCG} after chronic green tea polyphenol administration at a high daily bolus dose (800 mg {EGCG} or Polyphenon E once daily).},

Research on this medicinal plant has been aimed at validating traditional uses and deepening the mechanism of action, identifying the compounds responsible for these activities. The most investigated active compounds are aloe-emodin, aloin, aloesin, emodin, and acemannan. Likewise, new actions have been investigated for Aloe vera and its active compounds. This review provides an overview of current pharmacological studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials), written in English during the last six years (2014-2019). In particular, new pharmacological data research has shown that most studies refer to anti-cancer action, skin and digestive protective activity, and antimicrobial properties. Most recent works are in vitro and in vivo. Clinical trials have been conducted just with Aloe vera, but not with isolated compounds; therefore, it would be interesting to study the clinical effect of relevant metabolites in different human conditions and pathologies. The promising results of these studies in basic research encourage a greater number of clinical trials to test the clinical application of Aloe vera and its main compounds, particularly on bone protection, cancer, and diabetes.},

The various components of this system work in conjunction to carry out these functions—for example, body temperature regulation occurs through thermoreceptors that lead to the adjustment of peripheral blood flow, degree of perspiration, and body hair.},

	abstract = {Identification of natural products capable of affording protection against {UVB} radiation-induced inflammatory responses and generation of oxidative stress may have important human health implications. The {UVB} exposure-induced skin injury and oxidative stress has been associated with a variety of skin disease conditions including photoaging, inflammation and cancer. Tea is a popular beverage consumed worldwide. In several mouse skin models, topical application as well as oral consumption of green tea has been shown to afford protection against chemical and {UVB}-induced carcinogenesis and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we investigated in human skin, whether topical application of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}), the major polyphenolic constituent in green tea, inhibits {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes (macrophage/neutrophils), a potential source of generation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}), and generation of prostaglandin ({PG}) metabolites. Human subjects were {UVB} irradiated on sun-protected skin to four times their minimal erythema dosage ({MED}) and skin biopsies or keratomes were obtained either 24 h or 48 h later. We found that topical application of {EGCG} (3 mg/2.5 cm2) before {UVB} (4 {MED}) exposure to human skin significantly blocked {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes and reduced myeloperoxidase activity. These infiltrating leukocytes are considered to be the major source of generation of {ROS}. In the same set of experiments we found that topical application of {EGCG} before {UVB} exposure decreased {UVB}-induced erythema. In additional experiments, we found that microsomes from {EGCG} pretreated human skin and exposed to {UVB}, compared to {UVB} exposure alone, produced significantly reduced {PG} metabolites, particularly {PGE}2. The {PG} metabolites play a critical role in free radical generation and skin tumor promotion in multistage skin carcinogenesis. Careful microscopic examination of skin sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, under higher magnification (x400) also revealed that {EGCG} pretreated and {UVB}-exposed human skin contained fewer dead cells in the epidermis with comparison to nonpretreated {UVB}-exposed skin. Taken together, our data demonstrate that {EGCG} has the potential to block the {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes and the subsequent generation of {ROS} in human skin. This may explain the possible mechanism involved in anti-inflammatory effects of green tea. We suggest that {EGCG} may be useful as a topical agent for protection against {UVB}-induced {ROS}-associated inflammatory dermatoses, photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. Further studies are warranted in this direction.},

              Background and Objective
              Deep coagulation of skin collagen by Er:{YAG} laser repetitive pulses has been predicted by previous theoretical models and later demonstrated on animal skin. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of repetitive Er:{YAG} laser pulses on human skin and its response to this treatment.
            
            
              Study Design/Materials and Methods
              
                Lid skin of six female volunteers with blepharochalasis has been treated with laser at day 0, 7, and 21 before elective surgery—blepharoplasty. The treated skin was excised as part of the procedure and prepared for further histological examination. We used a 2,940 nm Er:{YAG} laser (Fidelis M320A by Fotona) with ‘smooth’ mode parameters: fluence from 0.50 to 2.00 J/cm
                2
                ; six pulses per packet; 550 μsecond/pulse, 250 millisecond/packet; single pass, no overlapping; spot size 5 mm; repetition rate 20 Hz.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                We observed deep collagen denaturation at laser fluences of 1.25 J/cm
                2
                and over; epidermal damage was proportional to fluence with total coagulation of the epidermal layer at fluences of 1.75 J/cm
                2
                and over. At day 7 after laser treatment we observed a complete regeneration of the epidermal layer and a regeneration zone within the dermis with prominent infiltration of {CD}68+ monocytes/macrophages. At day 21 after laser treatment we observed collagen remodeling and (myo‐)fibroblast proliferation at tissue depths of up to 240 μm.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Repetitive Er:{YAG} laser irradiation is effective in deep denaturation and remodeling of human skin collagen in vivo, with less epidermal damage compared to standard Er:{YAG} laser skin resurfacing. Lasers Surg. Med. 35:146–151, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The skin is the largest organ in the body and plays several essential functions acting as a barrier that protects us from physical and chemical insults, prevents the entrance of pathogens and the loss of water, besides playing an esential role in the regulation of body temperature. The skin displays a high regenerative capacity, evidenced by its self-renewing activity and the process of wound healing, driven by the existence of several resident stem cell populations. Due to the high prevalence of skin pathology, and their anatomical accessibility, skin biopsies and their subsequent microscopic observation constitute a powerfull tool for the study of primary skin diseases, as well as cutaneous manifestations of systemic diseases. This gave rise to dermatopathology as a specific discipline that unifies dermatology and pathology. In this setting, staining with hematoxylin and eosin constitutes the gold standard method for microscopic observation and diagnosis. Yet, several additional stains are used for specific purposes, such as trichrome stains for the staining of collagens in the extracellular matrix. We have applied a recently developed stain ({RGB} trichrome, acronym for picrosirius Red, fast Green and alcian Blue) to human samples to assess the staining outcomes in normal skin tissues. {RGB} staining provides a high contrasted interface between epidermis and dermis, and a comprehensible staining of the different dermal structures such as blood vessels, nerves, and sweat and sebaceous glands. The specific staining of collagens by picrosirius red can be useful for the objective quantification of these proteins under polarized light microscopy. In hair follicles, {RGB} staining resulted in specific staining of the epidermal sheaths and the encasing connective tissue (i.e., dermal sheath). Interestingly, the dermal sheath show two domains in which blue predominates over red staining, thus indicating that proteoglycans prevail in these areas. These two zones are the dermal papilla and an uncharacterized zone located at the upper isthmus, that we have denominated as proteoglycan-enriched belt ({PEB}). While the role of the papilla in the induction and regulation of hair growth is clearly established, the possible role of {PEB} remains to be determined and merits additional investigation.},

Topical applications of basic skin care products seem to reduce skin tear incidence. The suction blister method leads to the artificial and controlled separation of dermis and epidermis. Therefore, time to blister formation may be used as outcome measuring the strength of dermo‐epidermal adhesion. We conducted an exploratory, randomised, controlled trial with a split‐body design on forearms in healthy female subjects (n = 12; mean age 70.3 [{SD} 2.1] years). Forearms assigned to the intervention were treated twice daily with petrolatum for 8 weeks. Suction blisters were induced on forearms after 4 and 8 weeks and time to blister formation was measured. Stratum corneum and epidermal hydration were measured and epidermal thickness was assessed via optical coherence tomography. Time to blistering was longer and stratum corneum as well as epidermal hydration was consistently higher in intervention skin areas. We conclude that topical application of basic skin care products may improve mechanical adhesion of the dermo‐epidermal junction and that the parameter “time to blistering” is a suitable outcome to measure dermo‐epidermal adhesion strength in clinical research.},

	volume = {16},
	issn = {1107-3756},
	abstract = {Ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation from the sun is widely considered as a major cause of human skin photoaging and skin cancer. {UV} radiation-induced proinflammatory cytokines mediated by {NF}-{kappaB} reportedly play important roles in photoaging and cancer. {NF}-{kappaB} and cytokines have been thus perceived as molecular targets for pharmacological intervention. With an increasing amount of knowledge of the actions of green tea extracts at cellular and molecular levels, the beneficial effect of drinking green tea has become well recognized if not completely accepted. The components in green tea have even been added to skin-care products unregulated, while the molecular mechanisms of the actions of those components on human skin are being unraveled. Using cultured human keratinocytes, we investigated the effects of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}), a major polyphenolic constituent in green tea, on {UV}-induced activation of transcription factor {NF}-{kappaB} and proinflammatory pathway by measuring nuclear translocation of {NF}-{kappaB} and {IL}-6 secretion in vitro. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis and {ELISA} indicated that both nuclear p65 and secreted {IL}-6 were significantly (p{\textless}0.05) induced by {UVB} (20, 30 {mJ}/cm2) and {UVA} irradiation (10, 20 J/cm2). {NF}-{kappaB} nuclear translocation and {IL}-6 secretion induced by {UVB} and {UVA} were dramatically inhibited by treatment of {EGCG}. {FACS} analysis showed that {EGCG} also inhibited {UVB}-induced apoptosis. {EGCG} recovered {UV}-induced loss of anti-apoptotic component, bcl-2, and inhibited {UV}-induced apoptotic component, Fas ligand, expression. Collectively, we conclude that {EGCG} inhibits {UVB}- and {UVA}-induced proinflammatory pathway and inhibits apoptosis in cultured human keratinocytes in vitro. Our data suggest that {EGCG} be added to cosmetic or skin-care products for prevention from {UV}-induced skin photoaging if this activity can be further confirmed and no cytotoxicity is reported in human skin in vivo.},
