	abstract = {Traditional Chinese Medicine ({TCM}) consists of a plethora of therapeutic approaches aiming to both characterize and treat diseases. Its utilization has gained significant popularity in the western world and is even backed by the World Health Organization’s decision to include {TCM} diagnostic patterns into the new revision of the International Classification of Diseases code, the global standard for diagnostic health information. As these developments and potentially far-reaching decisions can affect modern healthcare systems and daily clinical work as well as wildlife conservation, its underlying factual basis must be critically examined. This article therefore provides an overview of the evidence underlying the basic {TCM} concepts, such as Qi, meridians, acupuncture, pulse and tongue diagnostics as well as traditional herbal treatments. Moreover, it discusses whether scientific literature on {TCM} reflects the current standard for evidence-based research, as described in good scientific practice and good clinical practice guidelines. Importantly, misinformation regarding the therapeutic efficacy of animal-derived substances has lead and currently leads to problems with wildlife preservation and animal ethics. Nevertheless, the (re-)discovery of artemisinin more than 50 years ago introduced a novel development in {TCM}: the commingling of Eastern and Western medicine, the appreciation of both systems. The need for more rigorous approaches, fulfilment of and agreement to current guidelines to achieve high-quality research are of utmost relevance. Thereby, ancient knowledge of herbal species and concoctions may serve as a possible treasure box rather than Pandora’s box.},

To carry their catalytic and structure-related functions, proteins must be correctly folded into their unique native three-dimensional structures. Common oxidative protein damage affects their functionality by impairing their catalytic and interactive specificities. Oxidative damage occurs preferentially to misfolded proteins and fixes the misfolded state. This review provides an overview of the mechanism and consequences of oxidative proteome damage - specifically irreversible protein carbonylation - in relation to ageing, including that of the skin as well as to age-related degeneration and diseases ({ARDD}) and their mitigation. A literature review of published manuscripts, available from {PubMed}, focusing on proteome, proteostasis, proteotoxicity, protein carbonylation, related inflammatory diseases, {ARDD} and the impact of the damaged proteome on ageing. During ageing, proteome damage, especially protein carbonylation, correlates with biological age. Carbonylated proteins form aggregates which can be considered as markers and accelerators of ageing and are common markers of most {ARDD}. Protein carbonylation leads to general ageing of the organism and organs including the skin and potentially to diseases including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, diabetes, psoriasis, and skin cancer. Current research is promising and may open new therapeutic approaches and perspectives by targeting proteome protection as an age and {ARDD} management strategy.},

This review explores the skin exposome and the role of a combination hyaluronic acid and mineralized thermal water product used to restore and maintain optimal skin barrier function.
{METHOD}: An expert panel of 7 dermatologists who treat clinical signs of facial aging convened for a one-day meeting to discuss the results of a literature review on the skin exposome and the role of M89, a mineralized thermal water and hyaluronic acid-based gel, to improve the quality of facial skin. Evidence coupled with expert opinion and experience of the panel was used to address clinical challenges in the treatment of photo-aging, and the use of M89.
{RESULTS}: Solar radiation (ultraviolet radiation, visible light, and infrared radiation), air pollution, tobacco smoke, nutrition, and miscellaneous factors, including stress, sleep deprivation, and temperature, may potentiate skin aging by triggering molecular processes that damage skin structure. M89 was developed to maintain and restore skin and contains ingredients to aid physical, hydric, antioxidant, and antimicrobial skin barrier function.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Increasing knowledge of the exposome and microenvironment contributing to skin aging may support a better understanding of measures to support the skin. The initial results of in vitro and clinical studies of M89 show its potential to improve skin barrier function.},

              Matricaria chamomilla
              (Asteraceae) in the twentieth century and has since been identified in other aromatic plants such as
              Eremanthus erythropappus

              α
              ‐bisabolol or bisabolol‐rich oil as an anti‐inflammatory agent is ubiquitous. This compound also exhibits several other pharmacological properties such as analgesic, antibiotic and anticancer activities. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity of bisabolol have also been investigated. Due to the low toxicity associated with bisabolol the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) has granted this constituent with Generally Regarded as Safe ({GRAS}) status which has promoted its use as an active ingredient in several commercial products. This review aims to summarise the role of
              α
              ‐bisabolol in pharmacological and/or physiological processes and to discuss some of the possible mechanisms of action of this commercially important molecule.},

Air pollution is the contamination of outdoor (ambient) and indoor (household) environments by any chemical, physical, or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Nearly all (90\%) of the world’s population experience daily pollution. In 2019, air pollution was considered by the World Health Organization to be the biggest environmental health risk to humans, responsible for killing more than 7 million people prematurely every year. Preliminary studies link air pollution to {COVID}-19 deaths, as there were high death tolls in some of the most globally polluted areas. Air pollution affects many organ systems such as cardiovascular, pulmonary, central nervous, reproductive, and integumentary systems. In this study, we detail the current evidence linking specific skin and health disorders to air pollution.},

In in vivo situations, polyphenolic anthranoids are extensively broken down into glucuronides and sulfate metabolites by the gut and the liver. The anti-inflammatory potential of aloe metabolites has not been examined. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of aloe metabolites from in vitro (lipopolysaccharides ({LPS})-activated {RAW}264.7 macrophages) and ex vivo ({LPS}-activated peritoneal macrophages) to in vivo ({LPS}-induced septic mice). The production of proinflammatory cytokines ({TNF}-

Furthermore, aloe administration significantly reduced the {NO} level and exhibited protective effects against sepsis-related death in {LPS}-induced septic mice. These results suggest that aloe metabolites exerted anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, and that these effects were associated with the inhibition of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, aloe could be considered an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of sepsis.},

	shorttitle = {Back to the roots},
	abstract = {Background
De Materia Medica written by Pedanios Dioscorides (1 century {CE}) has shaped European and Mediterranean herbal medicine to a large extent. Despite its fundamental importance for modern medico-botanical traditions the content of this work has never been systematically assessed.
Purpose
We present a quantitative survey of the botanical drugs described in De Materia Medica (ex Matthioli, 1568) and identify overall therapeutic, diachronic and botanical patterns. The extracted data may serve as a baseline and help to better contextualize research on herbal drugs and phytotherapy.
Methods
Therapeutic uses of herbal drugs were extracted through line-by-line reading of a digitized version of the treatise. For each plant usage mentioned in the text we recorded (I) the chapter number, ({II}) the putative botanical identity, ({III}) the plant part, ({IV}) the symptoms or disease, (V) the mode of administration, ({VI}) our biomedical interpretation of the ancient ailment or disease description as well as ({VII}) the organ- and symptom-defined category under which the use was filed.
Sections
An introduction to Dioscorides’ De Materia Medica and Matthioli's Renaissance commentary is followed by a description of the employed methodology. The results and discussion section introduces the generated database comprising 5314 unique therapeutic uses of 536 plant taxa and 924 herbal drugs. Separate subsections address salient patterns such as the frequent recommendation of Fabaceae seeds for dermatology, Apiaceae seeds as antidotes and Apiaceae exudates for neurology and psychosomatic disorders as well as the heavy reliance on subterranean parts as drugs.
Conclusions
The therapeutic knowledge described in De Materia Medica (ex Matthioli, 1568) offers unique insights into classical Mediterranean epidemiology and herbal medicine. Drugs that lost importance over time as well as remedies used for diseases now controlled by preventive medicine and industrially produced drugs may be interesting starting points for research on herbal medicine and drug discovery. Apart from promoting future data mining, the study may also help to prove the tradition of use, which is required for the regulatory approval of certain herbal products.},

	abstract = {Skin and soft tissue infections are quite common in elderly people. A number of special conditions and circumstances need to be considered in the diagnosis and therapy. It is important to try to establish the causative organism, exclude other cutaneous disorders and identify precipitating factors. Treatment modalities include antiseptics, topical and systemic antibacterials, dressings and biotherapy. Skin infections presenting with erythema, blisters, pustules, and ulcerations or in body folds are described in detail. Cellulitis and infected ulcers are the most commonly encountered cutaneous infections in the elderly. Accurate and quick diagnosis and treatment are imperative to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. Appropriate antibacterials, antiseptics and dressings are necessary depending on the severity of the clinical presentation and resistance patterns. Laboratory tests, such as skin swabs, to establish the exact pathogen take time and the results might represent colonisation rather than infection of the skin. Cellulitis should be clinically distinguished from erysipelas and necrotising fasciitis. The latter is a life-threatening condition, which in the majority of cases requires surgical debridement of the infected tissue. Blisters and honey-coloured crusts are typical features of impetigo. It is very contagious and close contacts should be examined. Folliculitis is a commonly seen skin infection, which often responds to the use of antiseptics and topical antibacterials. More severe pustular skin eruptions, such as furunculosis and carbunculosis, usually require treatment with systemic antibacterials. Intertrigo and erythrasma have a predilection for the body folds, especially the axillae and groin, and topical therapy is usually sufficient. Secondary skin infections are often the result of persistent pruritus associated with increasing dryness of the aging skin. Emollients and antihistamines are useful measures. Primary cutaneous disorders and systemic diseases should be excluded with the aid of appropriate investigations, such as blood tests and skin biopsy. Staphylococcus aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci are the most common causative organisms of cutaneous infections.},

              Objective
              The study was undertaken to compare the skin care related activities of retinol and bakuchiol, a potential alternative to retinoids. Retinol is a pivotal regulator of differentiation and growth of developing as well as adult skin. Retinoic acid is the major physiologically active metabolite of retinol regulating gene expression through retinoic acid receptor – dependant and independent pathways.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Comparative gene expression profiling of both substances in the {EpiDerm}
                {FT}
                full thickness skin substitute model was undertaken. Furthermore, type I, {III} and {IV} collagen, as well as aquaporin 3 expression was analyzed by {ELISA} and/or histochemistry in human dermal fibroblasts and/or Epiderm {FT} skin substitutes.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Bakuchiol is a meroterpene phenol abundant in seeds and leaves of the plant
                Psoralea corylifolia
                . We present evidence that bakuchiol, having no structural resemblance to retinoids, can function as a functional analogue of retinol. Volcano plots showed great overall similarity of retinol and bakuchiol effects on the gene expression profile. This similarity was confirmed by the side‐by‐side comparison of the modulation of individual genes, as well as on the protein level by {ELISA} and histochemistry. Retinol‐like functionality was further confirmed for the upregulation of types I and
                {IV}
                collagen in
                {DNA}
                microarray study and also show stimulation of type
                {III}
                collagen in the mature fibroblast model. Bakuchiol was also formulated into a finished skin care product and was tested in clinical case study by twice‐a‐day facial application. The results showed that, after 12 weeks treatment, significant improvement in lines and wrinkles, pigmentation, elasticity, firmness and overall reduction in photo‐damage was observed, without usual retinol therapy‐associated undesirable effects.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Based on these data, we propose that bakuchiol can function as an anti‐ageing compound through retinol‐like regulation of gene expression.

            Résumé
            
              Objectif
              L'étude a été menée pour comparer les activités liées aux soins de la peau du rétinol et du bakuchiol, une alternative potentielle aux rétinoïdes. Le rétinol est un régulateur essentiel de la différenciation et de la croissance de la peau en développement ainsi que la peau des adultes. L'acide rétinoïque est le principal métabolite physiologiquement actif du rétinol qui régule l'expression des gènes par des voies dépendantes et indépendantes du récepteur de l'acide rétinoïque.
            
            
              Méthodes
              
                Un profilage comparatif d'expression génétique de ces deux substances dans le modèle substitut de la peau {EpiDerm}
                {FT}
                a été entrepris. La synthèse des collagènes de type I,
                {III}
                et
                {IV}
                et de l'aquaporine 3 dans des fibroblastes dermiques humains normaux ont été analysés par
                {ELISA}
                et/ou en histochimie dans le modèle de peau {EpiDerm}
                {TM} {FT}
                .
              
            
            
              Résultats
              
                Bakuchiol est un phénol meroterpène abondant dans les graines et les feuilles de la
                Psoralea corylifolia
                . Nous présentons des preuves que bakuchiol, n'ayant aucune ressemblance structurelle avec les rétinoïdes, peut fonctionner comme un analogue fonctionnel de rétinol. Les diagrammes de type Volcano montrent la grande similitude de l'effet du rétinol et du bakuchiol sur l'expression des gènes. Cette ressemblance a été aussi démontrée par la comparaison de la modulation de l'expression de gènes particulaires, appartenant a de différentes groupes fonctionnelles. La fonctionnalité rétinol ‐like a été confirmée par la régulation à la hausse du collagène de type I et
                {IV}
                et aquaporine 3 au niveau de proteines par {ELISA} et histochimie. Le bakuchiol a également été formulé dans un produit de soin de la peau et a été testé dans une étude clinique avec deux applications par jour au visage. Les résultats ont montré que, après le traitement de douze semaines, une amélioration significative a été observée dans les rides et ridules, la pigmentation, l'élasticité, la fermeté et la réduction globale des dommages du photo‐vieillissement, sans les effets indésirables habituels associés à la thérapie au rétinol.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Sur la base de ces données, nous proposons que le bakuchiol peut fonctionner comme un composé anti‐ vieillissement grâce à la réglementation de l'expression des gènes similaire au rétinol.},

Here, we investigated the potential protective role of barbaloin in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced acute lung injury ({ALI}) and clarified the underlying mechanism in vitro. Histological analysis showed that barbaloin exhibited a certain protective effect on {LPS}-induced {ALI}. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the actions of barbaloin, {LPS}-stimulated macrophages were used in this study. The results showed that barbaloin decreased the phosphorylation levels of {IκBα} and {NF}-κB p65, leading to a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ({TNF}-α, {IL}-1β and {IL}-6). Furthermore, barbaloin also reduced the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) similarly to the antioxidant N‑acetyl‑l‑cysteine ({NAC}), which alone repressed the {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase ({PI}3K) and {AKT}. Additionally, a pharmacological inhibitor of {PI}3K/{AKT}, {LY}294002, also restrained the phosphorylation levels of {IκBα} and {NF}-κB p65 and thereby decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, these results show that barbaloin possesses a protective effect on {LPS}-induced {ALI} via suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the {ROS}-mediated {PI}3K/{AKT}/{NF}-κB pathway.},

However, little is known about the α-bisabolol biosynthesis pathway in German chamomile, especially the transcription factors ({TFs}) related to the regulation of α-bisabolol synthesis. In this study, we identified {MrFPS} and {MrBBS} and investigated their functions by prokaryotic expression and expression in hairy root cells of German chamomile. The results suggest that {MrFPS} is the key enzyme in the production of sesquiterpenoids, and {MrBBS} catalyzes the reaction that produces α-bisabolol. Subcellular localization analysis showed that both {MrFPS} and {MrBBS} proteins were located in the cytosol.

A large number of cis-acting elements related to light responsiveness, hormone response elements, and cis-regulatory elements that serve as putative binding sites for specific {TFs} in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses were identified. We identified and studied {TFs} related to {MrFPS} and {MrBBS}, including {WRKY}, {AP}2, and {MYB}.

The published literature was summarised and reviewed for historical/archaeological data on the usage and chemical composition of Egyptian eye cosmetics (‘kohls’). A total of 27 kohl samples were purchased in modern-day Egypt: 18 in Cairo, 4 in Aswan and 5 in Luxor. Also, very small amounts of material were carefully removed from inside six Pharaonic kohl pots (held in the Royal Albert Memorial Museum and Art Gallery, Exeter, {UK}). These pots were dated to either Middler or New Kingdom (i.e. between c. 2040 {BC} to c. 1070 {BC}). Each to the 33 samples was analysed by one or more of the following techniques: X-ray powder diffration ({XRPD}), low vacuum scanning electron microscopy ({LV} {SEM}), infrared spectroscopy ({IR}) and the relatively new technique of quantitative scanning electron microscopy ({QEMSCAN}). For the 27 modern-day samples, it was found that the main components for six was galena ({PbS}) and for the remaining samples one of the following: amorphous cabron (6), calcite ({CaCO}3) (6), elemental silicon (1), talc (Mg3Si4O10({OH})2) (2), cuprite (Cu2O) (1), goethite ({FeO}({OH}) (1), barite ({BaSO}4) (1), halite ({NaCl}) (1), and for two samples, an unknown amorphous organic compound. Three of the galena-based samples also had their (average) particle sizes determined from electron micrographs. Five of the six Pharaonic kohl pots contained lead-based conpounds (one being empty of kohl). Two were black and so were most likely galena, whilst the other three were white and so were one or more of several possible “made” or natural lead compounds. The composition of the six Pharaonic kohl pots was also studied (only using the {LV} {SEM} and {QEMSCAN} analystical techniques) and the results compared to the compositions expected from previous visual inspections. Whilst only about a quarter (22\%) of the modern-day Egyptian kohl samples contained a lead compound as a major component; it was seen, both from our results and those reviewed, that in the Pharaonic past this percentage was much higher.},

Exposure to traffic-related air pollution contributes to skin ageing. Particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide cause skin pigmentation/lentigines, while ozone causes wrinkles and has an impact on atopic eczema. Human skin is a major target of hormones, and they exhibit a wide range of biological activities on the skin. Hormones decline with advancing age influencing skin ageing. Nutrition has an impact on numerous biochemical processes, including oxidation, inflammation and glycation, which may result in clinical effects, including modification of the course of skin ageing and photoageing. Stress and lack of sleep are known to contribute to a pro-inflammatory state, which, in turn, affects the integrity of extracellular matrix proteins, in particular collagen. Hormone dysregulation, malnutrition and stress may contribute to inflammatory skin disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne and rosacea.},

The results show thirty-two batik dyeing and/or rinsing workers were enrolled in the study with mild to moderate {OHD}. Clinical improvement was demonstrated by 20\% decrease in {HECSI} and {TEWL}, and 20\% increase in skin capacitance. Both moisturizers were equally effective for the secondary prevention of {OHD}.

Oxidative stress contributes to skin aging and can adversely affect skin health, which means antioxidants active in skin cells may support skin health. We examined 25 traditional Chinese herbal medicines that might be useful for skin-whitening and skin health. Extracts (100μg/{mL}) were tested for cytotoxicity on human epidermal melanocytes ({HEMn}); 12 exhibited low cytotoxicity. Their effects on tyrosinase and melanin inhibitory activities and free radical scavenging activities were further assessed. Phenolic contents were evaluated using Folin–Ciocalteu reagent. Four herbs, Pharbitis nil, Sophora japonica, Spatholobus suberectus, and Morus alba, exhibited potent inhibitory effects on tyrosinase ({IC}50 values 24.9, 95.6, 83.9, and 78.3μg/{mL}, respectively). Melanin inhibition was not dose-dependent. Sophora japonica ({IC}50: 14.46μg/{mL}, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl ({DPPH}); 1.95μg/{mL}, hydroxyl radical) and Spatholobus suberectus ({IC}50: 10.51μg/{mL}, {DPPH}; 4.36μg/{mL}, hydroxyl radical) showed good antioxidative activities and high phenolic contents (255 and 189mg of gallic acid/g extract, respectively). Among active anti-tyrosinase extracts, Sophora japonica and Spatholobus suberectus were especially potent in {HEMn} cells in terms of free radical scavenging effects and high phenolic contents, making them the strongest candidates for cosmetic application found in the current study.},

Keratinocytes make up the main cellular constitute of the outermost layer of the skin, contributing to the formation of the epidermis, and they are crucial for maintaining the integrity of this barrier. Beyond serving as a physical barrier component, keratinocytes actively participate in maintaining tissue homeostasis, shaping, amplifying, and regulating immune responses in skin. Keratinocytes act as sentinels, continuously monitoring changes in the environment, and, through microbial sensing, stretch, or other physical stimuli, can initiate a broad range of inflammatory responses via secretion of various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. This diverse function of keratinocytes contributes to the highly variable clinical manifestation of skin immune responses.

	abstract = {{SIGNIFICANCE}: Chronic exposure to environmental ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) plays a key role in both photocarcinogenesis and induction of accelerated skin aging. Although the spatiotemporal consequences of {UVR} exposure for the composition and architecture of the dermal extracellular matrix ({ECM}) are well characterized, the pathogenesis of photoaging remains poorly defined. Given the compelling evidence for the role of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) as mediators of photoaging, {UVR}-exposed human skin may be an accessible model system in which to characterize the role of oxidative damage in both internal and external tissues.
{RECENT} {ADVANCES}: Although the cell-mediated degradation of dermal components via {UVR}-induced expression of {ECM} proteases has long been identified as an integral part of the photoaging pathway, the relative importance and identity of cellular and extracellular photosensitizers (direct hit and bystanders models, respectively) in initiating this enzymatic activity is unclear. Recently, both age-related protein glycation and relative amino-acid composition have been identified as potential risk factors for photo-ionization and/or photo-sensitization. Here, we propose a selective multi-hit model of photoaging.
{CRITICAL} {ISSUES}: Bioinformatic analyses can be employed to identify candidate {UVR} targets/photosensitizers, but the action of {UVR} on protein structure and/or {ROS} production should be verified experimentally. Crucially, in the case of biochemically active {ECM} components such as fibronectin and fibrillin, the downstream effects of photo-degradation on tissue homeostasis remain to be confirmed.
{FUTURE} {DIRECTIONS}: Both topical antioxidants and inhibitors of detrimental cell signaling may be effective in abrogating the effects of specific {UVR}-mediated protein degradation in the dermis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previous studies on the age-, climate, and skin care habit-related changes of biophysical parameters have mainly focused on Caucasians, and studies on Asians are in paucity.
{OBJECTIVE}: This study was aimed to investigate the variations of cutaneous biophysical parameters in Chinese and Korean women (northeast Asians) and to assess the association between those parameters and age, climate, and cosmetic habits.
{METHODS}: A cross-sectional study included 361 healthy Chinese and Korean women between 18 and 49 years of age in 4 cities (Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Shijiazhuang in China, and Suwon in Korea). We measured skin surface temperature, hydration, transepidermal water loss ({TEWL}), sebum, elasticity, skin pore, wrinkle, and skin tone (brightness) using non-invasive instruments. Demographic profiles and cosmetic habits were assessed using a questionnaire.
{RESULTS}: Skin elasticity and tone decreased, and pore size and wrinkle increased with age. Subjects in Suwon (Korean) showed higher hydration level, lower {TEWL} and lower sebum, less severe wrinkle and brighter skin than those in the 3 cities in China. After adjusting for age and region, using sunscreen everyday, wearing base makeup daily, and using moisturizers improved hydration, {TEWL}, and elasticity significantly.
{CONCLUSION}: Women in Suwon (Korea) were found to have a better profile of biophysical parameters than women in the 3 Chinese cities, which might be attributed to cosmetic habits, besides age and climatic factors. The fact that appropriate cosmetic habits are associated with favorable skin biophysical parameters underscores the importance of daily skin care routine in preserving skin functions.},

The goal of the current study was to ascertain the effect of olive oil and sunflower seed oil on the biophysical properties of the skin. Nineteen adult volunteers with and without a history of atopic dermatitis were recruited into two randomized forearm-controlled mechanistic studies. The first cohort applied six drops of olive oil to one forearm twice daily for 5 weeks. The second cohort applied six drops of olive oil to one forearm and six drops of sunflower seed oil to the other twice daily for 4 weeks. The effect of the treatments was evaluated by determining stratum corneum integrity and cohesion, intercorneocyte cohesion, moisturization, skin-surface {pH}, and erythema. Topical application of olive oil for 4 weeks caused a significant reduction in stratum corneum integrity and induced mild erythema in volunteers with and without a history of atopic dermatitis. Sunflower seed oil preserved stratum corneum integrity, did not cause erythema, and improved hydration in the same volunteers. In contrast to sunflower seed oil, topical treatment with olive oil significantly damages the skin barrier, and therefore has the potential to promote the development of, and exacerbate existing, atopic dermatitis. The use of olive oil for the treatment of dry skin and infant massage should therefore be discouraged. These findings challenge the unfounded belief that all natural oils are beneficial for the skin and highlight the need for further research.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hospitalized preterm infants with compromised skin barrier function treated topically with sunflower seed oil ({SSO}) have shown reductions in sepsis and neonatal mortality rate ({NMR}). Mustard oil and products commonly used in high-mortality settings may possibly harm skin barrier integrity and enhance risk of infection and mortality in newborn infants. We hypothesized that {SSO} therapy may reduce {NMR} in such settings.
{METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS}: This was a population-based, cluster randomized, controlled trial in 276 clusters in rural Uttar Pradesh, India. All newborn infants identified through population-based surveillance in the study clusters within 7 days of delivery were enrolled from November 2014 to October 2016. Exclusive, 3 times daily, gentle applications of 10 ml of {SSO} to newborn infants by families throughout the neonatal period were recommended in intervention clusters (n = 138 clusters); infants in comparison clusters (n = 138 clusters) received usual care, such as massage practice typically with mustard oil. Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat with {NMR} and post-24-hour {NMR} as the primary outcomes. Secondary analysis included per-protocol analysis and subgroup analyses for {NMR}. Regression analysis was adjusted for caste, first-visit weight, delivery attendant, gravidity, maternal age, maternal education, sex of the infant, and multiple births. We enrolled 13,478 (52.2\% male, mean weight: 2,575.0 grams ± standard deviation [{SD}] 521.0) and 13,109 (52.0\% male, mean weight: 2,607.0 grams ± {SD} 509.0) newborn infants in the intervention and comparison clusters, respectively. We found no overall difference in {NMR} in the intervention versus the comparison clusters [adjusted odds ratio ({aOR}) 0.96, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.84 to 1.11, p = 0.61]. Acceptance of {SSO} in the intervention arm was high at 89.3\%, but adherence to exclusive applications of {SSO} was 30.4\%. Per-protocol analysis showed a significant 58\% (95\% {CI} 42\% to 69\%, p {\textless} 0.01) reduction in mortality among infants in the intervention group who were treated exclusively with {SSO} as intended versus infants in the comparison group who received exclusive applications of mustard oil. A significant 52\% (95\% {CI} 12\% to 74\%, p = 0.02) reduction in {NMR} was observed in the subgroup of infants weighing ≤1,500 g (n = 589); there were no statistically significant differences in other prespecified subgroup comparisons by low birth weight ({LBW}), birthplace, and wealth. No severe adverse events ({SAEs}) were attributable to the intervention. The study was limited by inability to mask allocation to study workers or participants and by measurement of emollient use based on caregiver responses and not actual observation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In this trial, we observed that promotion of {SSO} therapy universally for all newborn infants was not effective in reducing {NMR}. However, this result may not necessarily establish equivalence between {SSO} and mustard oil massage in light of our secondary findings. Mortality reduction in the subgroup of infants ≤1,500 g was consistent with previous hospital-based efficacy studies, potentially extending the applicability of emollient therapy in very low-birth-weight ({VLBW}) infants along the facility-community continuum. Further research is recommended to develop and evaluate therapeutic regimens and continuum of care delivery strategies for emollient therapy for newborn infants at highest risk of compromised skin barrier function.

	abstract = {The increase in air pollution over the years has had major effects on the human skin. Various air pollutants such as ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, oxides, particulate matter, ozone and cigarette smoke affect the skin as it is the outermost barrier. Air pollutants damage the skin by inducing oxidative stress. Although human skin acts as a biological shield against pro-oxidative chemicals and physical air pollutants, prolonged or repetitive exposure to high levels of these pollutants may have profound negative effects on the skin. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation has been associated with extrinsic skin aging and skin cancers. Cigarette smoke contributes to premature aging and an increase in the incidence of psoriasis, acne and skin cancers. It is also implicated in allergic skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and eczema. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are associated with extrinsic skin aging, pigmentation, cancers and acneiform eruptions. Volatile organic compounds have been associated with atopic dermatitis. Given the increasing levels of air pollution and its detrimental effects on the skin, it is advisable to use strategies to decrease air pollution.},

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of {AD} in adults and by disease severity.
Methods: This international, cross-sectional, web-based survey was performed in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and Japan. Adult members of online respondent panels were sent a questionnaire for {AD} identification and severity assessment; demographic quotas ensured population representativeness for each country. A diagnosis of {AD} required subjects to be positive on the modified {UK} Working Party/{ISAAC} criteria and self-report of ever having an {AD} diagnosis by a physician. The proportion of subjects with {AD} who reported being treated for their condition was determined and also used to estimate prevalence. Severity scales were Patient-Oriented {SCORAD}, Patient-Orientated Eczema Measure, and Patient Global Assessment.
Results: Among participants by region, the point prevalence of adult {AD} in the overall/treated populations was 4.9\%/3.9\% in the {US}, 3.5\%/2.6\% in Canada, 4.4\%/3.5\% in the {EU}, and 2.1\%/1.5\% in Japan. The prevalence was generally lower for males vs females, and decreased with age. Regional variability was observed within countries. Severity varied by scale and region; however, regardless of the scale or region, proportion of subjects reporting severe disease was lower than mild or moderate disease.
Conclusions: Prevalence of adult {AD} ranged from 2.1\% to 4.9\% across countries. Severe {AD} represented a small proportion of the overall {AD} population regardless of measure or region.},

	abstract = {As the population of postmenopausal women increases, interest in the effects of estrogen grows. The influence of estrogen on several body systems has been well-documented; however, one area that has not been explored is the effects of estrogen on skin. Estrogen appears to aid in the prevention of skin aging in several ways. This reproductive hormone prevents a decrease in skin collagen in postmenopausal women; topical and systemic estrogen therapy can increase the skin collagen content and therefore maintain skin thickness. In addition, estrogen maintains skin moisture by increasing acid mucopolysaccharides and hyaluronic acid in the skin and possibly maintaining stratum corneum barrier function. Sebum levels are higher in postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy. Skin wrinkling also may benefit from estrogen as a result of the effects of the hormone on the elastic fibers and collagen. Outside of its influence on skin aging, it has been suggested that estrogen increases cutaneous wound healing by regulating the levels of a cytokine. In fact, topical estrogen has been found to accelerate and improve wound healing in elderly men and women. The role of estrogen in scarring is unclear but recent studies indicate that the lack of estrogen or the addition of tamoxifen may improve the quality of scarring. Unlike skin aging, the role of endogenous and exogenous estrogen in melanoma has not been well established.},

At present, traditional knowledge concerning home-made phytocosmetics is represented by both the remnants of an orally transmitted folk heritage and also by new forms of knowledge, sometimes coming from popular phytotherapeutical books and the mass media (out of the scope of this survey), but also as a result of recent migration trends from Eastern Europe. We recorded approximately 135 cosmetic or cosmeceutical preparations prepared from more than 70 botanical species and a very few animal or mineral ingredients. Among the recorded preparations, developing a clear distinction amongst cosmetics, cosmeceuticals and pharmaceuticals for skin diseases is very problematic, confirming that in folk knowledge systems medicinal products for healing skin diseases and cosmetics have often been perceived as two poles of a continuum. Many of the quoted species represented well-known medicinal plants of the European phytotherapy, although we also recorded a few unusual plant taxa, which are briefly discussed under the perspective of their eventual phytochemical and/or phytopharmacological potentialities. Exotic drugs or precious essences, even native of the Mediterranean, were not quoted as ingredients for preparing perfumes and fragrances by the interviewees of the present study, thus indicating that popular cosmetic practices in rural Central Italy have taken a much separated path away from the cosmetic “know-how” of the aristocracy and high bourgeois classes of the last centuries.},

Investigate the endocrine effects of {IFs} and {ENL} in humans, focusing on systemic lupus erythematosus ({SLE}) and triple-negative breast cancer. 3. Develop techniques to reduce the {IFs} content of soy-based food products.
Methodology: 1. {IF} and {ENL} Exposure Assessment: - Food analyses and dietary intake assessment to quantify the French exposure to {IFs} and lignans. - Development and validation of food questionnaires to evaluate soy and lignans consumption. - Measurements of {IFs} and {ENL} in biological fluids (blood, urine) and hair. 2. Endocrine effects of {IFs} and {ENL}: - Case-control study on {SLE}, comparing {IFs} and {ENL} exposure in patients and in healthy controls. - In vitro studies on triple-negative breast cancer cells, analyzing the effect of {IFs} on cell proliferation and their interactions with the {GPER}, a membrane estrogen receptor. 3. Reduction of {IF} levels: - Development of (pre)industrial rinsing processes to decrease {IFs} content in soybeans. - Investigation of traditional Asian recipes and domestic water rinsing techniques for reducing {IFs} in soy-based foods.
Results: 1. {IFs} and Lignans exposure: - French exposure to {IFs} is significant, even for non-soy consumers, due to “hidden soy” in ultra-processed foods. - The developed food questionnaires are validated, and a method for {IFs} and {ENL} analysis in hair is presented. 2. Endocrine effects of {IFs} and {ENL}: - Preliminary findings from the {SLE} cohort suggest a potential association between {ENL} and a healthier status. However, the limited sample size necessitates further investigation to definitively exclude an impact of {IFs}. - {IFs} and their circulating conjugates might promote triple-negative breast cancer cells proliferation through the {GPER}. 3. Reducing {IF} levels: - Industrial rinsing processes can effectively reduce {IFs} content in soybean by 50\%. - Traditional Asian preparation methods and domestic rinsing significantly decrease {IFs} in soy-based products. Discussion: Soy consumption warrants specific attention due to the endocrine effects of {IFs}. Further research is crucial to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these effects and formulate recommendations for safe soy consumption.
Conclusion: While soy consumption holds nutritional value and boasts a long tradition in Asia, its high isoflavone content raises questions about its potential impact on human health. This thesis contributes preliminary insights into French exposure to {IFs}, their possible effects on {SLE} and triple-negative breast cancer, and proposes solutions for mitigating {IFs} levels in soy-based foods},

Although the exploitation of ochre is viewed as a key feature of the emergence of modern human behaviour, the uses to which ochre and ochre-based mixtures were put remain ambiguous. Here we present the results of an experimental study exploring the efficacy of ochre as a topical photoprotective compound. This is achieved through the in vivo calculation of the sun protection factor ({SPF}) values of ochre samples obtained from Ovahimba women (Kunene Region, Northern Namibia) and the Palaeozoic Bokkeveld Group deposits of the Cape Supergroup (Western Cape Province, South Africa). We employ visible spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence ({ED}-{XRF}), X-ray diffraction ({XRD}) and granulometric analyses to characterise ochre samples. The capacity of ochre to inhibit the susceptibility of humans to the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) is confirmed and the mechanisms implicated in the efficacy of ochre as a sunscreen identified. It is posited that the habitual application of ochre may have represented a crucial innovation for {MSA} humans by limiting the adverse effects of ultraviolet exposure. This may have facilitated the colonisation of geographic regions largely unfavourable to the constitutive skin colour of newly arriving populations.},

{OBJECTIVES}: To quantify global, regional and country-specific estimates of the epidemiology of {AD}.
{METHODS}: A comprehensive search for epidemiological studies in {AD} was conducted in four electronic databases ({PubMed}, Embase, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure). A Bayesian hierarchical linear mixed model was constructed to calculate epidemiological estimates of {AD} considering the heterogeneity of regions, countries, type of diagnoses and age strata.
{RESULTS}: In total, 344 studies met the inclusion criteria. Incidence varied substantially with the location and age of the surveyed participants. The global prevalence of {AD} and the population affected by {AD} were estimated to be 2.6\% [95\% uncertainty interval ({UI}) 1.9-3.5] and 204.05 million people, respectively. Around 101.27 million adults and 102.78 million children worldwide have {AD}, corresponding to prevalence rates of 2.0\% (95\% {UI} 1.4-2.6) and 4.0\% (95\% {UI} 2.8-5.3), respectively. Females were more likely to suffer from {AD} than males: the global prevalence of {AD} in females was 2.8\% (95\% {UI} 2.0-3.7\%) and affected 108.29 million people, while in males the corresponding estimates were 2.4\% (95\% {UI} 1.7-3.3\%) and 95.76 million people.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Epidemiological {AD} data are lacking in 41.5\% of countries worldwide. The epidemiology of {AD} varies substantially with age and sex and is distributed unequally across geographical regions.},

Multiple colonial initiatives to develop the global trade were not successful due to a composite of factors. Contemporary patterns of production, trade and regulation are contrasted in the context of globalisation in the post-independence era. The government of Ghana has progressively reinforced its ambitions to expand the shea nut trade as part of the state’s portfolio of major non-traditional agricultural export commodities. This policy is embedded within the (now) dominant orthodoxy of neo-liberalism, which privileges monetized production systems and private over public regulation. Historically and culturally-embedded patterns of shea production and trade by women in northern Ghana may now be challenged by the emergence of new processing technologies, the emergence of an oligopolistic global commodity chain and the anticipated continued growth in global demand for cocoa butter equivalents.  Nevertheless, the cumulative impacts of increasing commercialisation and world market integration at the national and local level in Ghana, and other West African producer countries, are still unknown. There are risks, however, that this process may result in social differentiation, changes in household consumption patterns and loss of livelihoods, particularly for women.},

	abstract = {Dietary flavonoids may protect against sunburn inflammation in skin. Preliminary reports using less complete analysis suggest that certain catechins and their metabolites are found in skin biopsies and blister fluid after consumption of green tea; however, it is not known if they are affected by solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) or whether conjugated forms, with consequently altered bioactivity, are present. The present study tested the hypothesis that {UVR} affects the catechin levels in the skin of healthy volunteers after consumption of green tea and how catechins in the plasma are related to their presence in skin tissue samples. In an open oral intervention study, 11 subjects consumed green tea and vitamin C supplements daily for 3months. Presupplementation and postsupplementation plasma samples, suction blister fluid and skin biopsies were collected; the latter two samples were collected both before and after {UVR}. A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric assay was used to measure the intact catechin metabolites, conjugates and free forms. Seven green tea catechins and their corresponding metabolites were identified postsupplementation in skin biopsies, 20 in blister fluid and 26 in plasma, with 15 green tea catechin metabolites present in both blister fluid and plasma. The valerolactone, O-methyl-M4-O-sulfate, a gut microbiota metabolite of catechins, was significantly increased 1.6-fold by {UVR} in blister fluid samples. In conclusion, there were some common catechin metabolites in the plasma and blister fluid, and the concentration was always higher in plasma. The results suggest that green tea catechins and metabolites are bioavailable in skin and provide a novel link between catechin metabolites derived from the skin and gut microbiota.},

The green tea constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}) is a potent antioxidant and has shown remarkable preventive effects against photocarcinogenesis and phototoxicity in mouse models. In this study we have investigated the effects of topical application of {EGCG}, the major polyphenol present in green tea, to human skin before {UV} irradiation on {UV}-induced markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymes. Using immunohistochemistry and analytical enzyme assays, we found that application of {EGCG} (mg/cm(2) skin) before a single {UV} exposure of 4x minimal erythema dose ({MED}) markedly decreases {UV}-induced production of hydrogen peroxide (68-90\%, P {\textless} 0.025-0.005) and nitric oxide (30-100\%, P {\textless} 0.025-0.005) in both epidermis and dermis in a time-dependent manner. {EGCG} pretreatment also inhibits {UV}-induced infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes, particularly {CD}11b(+) cells (a surface marker of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils), into the skin, which are considered to be the major producers of reactive oxygen species. {EGCG} treatment was also found to inhibit {UV}-induced epidermal lipid peroxidation at each time point studied (41-84\%, P {\textless} 0.05). A single {UV} exposure of 4x {MED} to human skin was found to increase catalase activity (109-145\%) and decrease glutathione peroxidase ({GPx}) activity (36-54\%) and total glutathione ({GSH}) level (13-36\%) at different time points studied. Pretreatment with {EGCG} was found to restore the {UV}-induced decrease in {GSH} level and afforded protection to the antioxidant enzyme {GPx}. Further studies are warranted to study the preventive effects of {EGCG} against multiple exposures to {UV} light of human skin.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation-induced infiltrating leukocytes, depletion of antigen-presenting cells, and oxidative stress in the skin play an important role in the induction of immune suppression and photocarcinogenesis. Earlier we have shown that topical application of polyphenols from green tea or its major chemopreventive constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}) prevents {UV}-B-induced immunosuppression in mice. To define the mechanism of prevention, we found that topical application of {EGCG} (3 mg/mouse/3 cm(2) of skin area) to C3H/{HeN} mice before a single dose of {UV}-B (90 {mJ}/cm(2)) exposure inhibited {UV}-B-induced infiltration of leukocytes, specifically the {CD}11b+ cell type, and myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of tissue infiltration of leukocytes. {EGCG} treatment was also found to prevent {UV}-B-induced depletion in the number of antigen-presenting cells when immunohistochemically detected as class {II} {MHC}+ Ia+ cells. {UV}-B-induced infiltrating cell production of H2O2 and nitric oxide ({NO}) was determined as a marker of oxidative stress. We found that pretreatment of {EGCG} decreased the number of {UV}-B-induced increases in H2O2-producing cells and inducible nitric oxide synthase-expressing cells and the production of H2O2 and {NO} in both epidermis and dermis at a {UV}-B-irradiated site. Together, these data suggest that prevention of {UV}-B-induced infiltrating leukocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and oxidative stress by {EGCG} treatment of mouse skin may be associated with the prevention of {UV}-B-induced immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis.},

We begin with an introduction to the art and science of cosmetics in the ancient world, which includes accounts of Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, and Roman cosmetics as well as Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic Medicine. These dermatological and cosmetic practices, which were advanced for the time, paved the way for the current revolution of natural ingredients in cosmetic products. Without providing a comprehensive historical account, we surveyed selected cultures during different periods of time to provide some perspective of our current understanding of natural ingredients in cosmetics. Attention is also given to the rich contributions of body art by tribal societies to our knowledge base, especially in the areas of dyes and pigments.

Classical and Hellenistic periods should be considered as the most progressive eras in the design of sanitary engineering. At that time anatomically shaped toilet seats are found in several sites since many private houses and public buildings have them. As cities grew in size the pressure of larger populations resulted in the construction of communal toilets with seats that were more densely packed together. Drainage and sewerage systems and sanitary installations reflect high cultural and technological levels and they are associated with contemporary observations and ideas about hygiene and medicine. Before the Hellenic advances, medicine was entirely confined to religious beliefs and metaphysical rituals. In the early Roman period, the knowledge of the ancient world on hygienic matter was incorporated in legislative rules. Despite the weakening of this legislation through the ages, the sanitation practices kept being applied even via a technical tradition of the masons. Later various rulers of the Hellenic world (Europeans or Ottomans), introduced their practices (traditional/scientific) sanitation in the greater Helladic regions.},

	abstract = {Synopsis The efficacy of ellagic acid ({EA}), one of the naturally occurring polyphenols, in inhibiting melanogenesis was examined in vitro and in vivo. When mushroom-derived tyrosinase, a metaloprotein containing copper, was incubated with {EA}, enzymatic activity tended to decrease with decreasing copper concentration. Enzyme activity partially recovered when copper was added to the inactivated enzyme. Tyrosinase activity in the B16 melanoma cells was observed to recover in a dose-dependent manner when copper ions were added to the medium containing {EA}. Based on these results, {EA} is thought to react specifically with the copper located at the active centre of the tyrosinase molecule. Furthermore, when {EA} was applied for 6 weeks to brownish guinea-pigs, which have melanocytes in their skin, at the same time as irradiating for 2 weeks with ultra-violet light, skin pigmentation was clearly suppressed and the skin to which {EA} had been applied showed features similar to that of non-irradiated skin. These areas were irradiated again when the application of {EA} had been completed, and skin pigmentation occurred at the former site of {EA} application. In similar studies with hydroquinone, re-pigmentation did not occur on the sites at which hydroquinone (1\%) had been applied. Based on the results reported here, {EA} is thought to suppress melanogenesis by reacting with activated melanocytes and without injuring cells. Résumé Le pouvoir inhibiteur de la melanogenese par l’acide élagique ({AE}), un polyphénol naturel, a étéétudiéin vitro et in vivo. Nous avons fait incuber avec l’{AE} la tyrosinase extraite de champignons. C’est une métallo-protéine contenant du cuivre dont l’activité enzymatique tend à diminuer proportionnellement à la diminution de concentration en cuivre. Mais l’activité enzymatique se restaure partiellement, lorsque du cuivre est ajouté au milieu. Par ailleurs, l’activité de la tyrosinase dans des cellules de mélanome B16 s’exprime de façon dependante des ions cuivre ajoutés au milieu contenant l’{AE}. Sur la base de ces résultats, on peut penser que l’{AE} réagit de manière spécifique vis à vis du cuivre situé au centre actif de la molécule de tyrosinase. De plus, l’{AE} a été appliqué sur la peau de cochons d’Inde bruns durant 6 semaines. Ces animaux possèdent des mélanocytes cutanés, et suite à irradition simultanée aux {UV} pendant 2 semaines, la pigmentation cutanée disparait clairement. La peau sur laquelle on a appliqué l’{AE} montre des caractères similaires à ceux de la peau non-irradiée. Lorsque ces surfaces furent irradiées à leur tour en fin de période d’application, on observa la re-pigmentation de la peau à l’endroit de l’application de l’{AE}. Par des experiénces comparables avec de l’hydroquinone, le phénomène de re-pigmentation aux points d’application d’hydroquinone (en solution a 1\%) n’a pas été observé. A la base de ces résultats, on peut penser que l’{AE} inhibe la mélanogénèse par réaction avec les mélanocytes activés, sans endommager les cellules.},

Because psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by a hyperproliferative activity of keratinocytes and an inflammatory infiltrate, in the present study {IL}-6 production of monocytes and keratinocytes of patients with psoriasis was investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}) derived from psoriatics, atopics, and healthy controls were incubated for 24 h and, subsequently, supernatant {IL}-6 activity was measured using an {IL}-6-dependent hybridoma cell line (B9). Compared to controls and atopics, {PBMC} of psoriatics produced significantly increased amounts of biologically active {IL}-6. These findings were also confirmed by Western blot analysis using a specific antiserum directed against {IL}-6. Moreover, when the sera of the same patients were tested for {IL}-6 activity, sera of psoriatics contained significantly elevated amounts of circulating {IL}-6 in comparison to samples from atopics and healthy controls. In contrast to normal or uninvolved skin, keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions were remarkably positive for {IL}-6 as detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In addition, {IL}-6 also was found to induce its own synthesis and release by monocytes. These findings indicate that keratinocytes and monocytes in psoriasis are activated to produce increased amounts of {IL}-6, which may be one of the mediators involved in the regulation of both local and systemic inflammatory reactions occurring in skin diseases such as psoriasis.},

	abstract = {Although (-)-α-bisabolol, a natural monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol, is often used as a cosmetic soothing supplement, little is known about its mechanisms of anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate anti-inflammatory effects of (-)-α-bisabolol and its mechanisms of action. In this study, we found that (-)-α-bisabolol inhibited lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced production of nitric oxide ({NO}) and prostaglandin E(2) ({PGE}(2)) in {RAW}264.7 cells. In addition, expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ({COX}-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase ({iNOS}) genes was reduced, as evidenced by Western blot and luciferase reporter assays for {COX}-2 and {iNOS}. To assess the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory property of (-)-α-bisabolol, its effects on the activity of {AP}-1 and {NF}-κB promoters were examined. {LPS}-induced activation of {AP}-1 and {NF}-κB promoters was significantly reduced by (-)-α-bisabolol. Consistently, (-)-α-bisabolol reduced {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of {IκBα}. In addition, while {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of {ERK} and p38 was attenuated by (-)-α-bisabolol, significant changes in the level of phosphorylated {JNK} were not observed. Our results indicate that (-)-α-bisabolol exerts anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating expression of {iNOS} and {COX}-2 genes through inhibition of {NF}-κB and {AP}-1 ({ERK} and p38) signaling.},

	volume = {32},
	doi = {10.1111/jdv.15026},
	shorttitle = {Katharsis of the skin},
	abstract = {Background
Recipes for peelings date back to medical texts of old Egypt. The oldest medical papyri contain recipes for “improving beauty of the skin” and “removing wrinkles” by use of agents like salt and soda. The Egyptian Queen Cleopatra (69–30 {BC}) is said to have taken bathes in donkey's milk in order to improve the beauty of her skin. However, little is known about other agents and peeling applications in later Greek medical textbooks.

Objective
We will discover new agents and describe ancient peeling applications. First, we will have to identify ancient Greek medical terms for the modern terms “peeling” and “chemical peeling”. Second, based on the identified terms we will perform a systematic fulltext search for agents in original sources. Third, we will categorize the results into three peeling applications: (1) cleansing, (2) aesthetical improvement of the skin, and (3) therapy of dermatological diseases.

Methods
We performed a full systematic keyword search with the identified Greek terms in databases of ancient Greek texts. Our keywords for peeling and chemical peeling are “smēxis” and “trīpsis”. Our keywords for agents of peeling and chemical peeling are “smégmata”, “rhýmmata”, “kathartiká”, and “trímmata”.

Results
Diocles (4th century {BC}) was the first one who mentioned “smēxis” and “trīpsis” as parts of daily cleansing routine. Criton (2nd century {AD}) wrote about peeling applications, but any reference to the agents is lost. Antyllos (2nd century {AD}) composed three lists of peeling applications including agents.

Conclusion
Greek medical textbooks of Graeco‐Roman antiquity report several peeling applications like cleansing, brightening, darkening, softening, and aesthetical improvement of the skin by use of peeling and chemical peeling, as well as therapy of dermatological diseases. There are 27 ancient agents for what is contemporarily called peeling and chemical peeling. We discovered more specific agents than hitherto known to research.

{OBJECTIVE}: Our purpose was to investigate alterations in the production and morphology of collagen fibers brought about by long-term sun exposure.
{METHODS}: We compared collagen and collagenase gene expression and collagen immunohistochemical staining and used confocal laser scanning microscopy for morphologic examination of dermal collagen fibers in photodamaged compared with sun-protected skin from the same persons.
{RESULTS}: Despite a large increase in elastin messenger {RNA} in sun-damaged skin, collagen and collagenase gene expression remained essentially unchanged. However, striking alterations in the papillary dermis of photoaged skin were found, which revealed large, abnormally clumped elastic fibers and deformed collagen fibers of various diameters, replacing the normal architecture of the papillary dermis.
{CONCLUSION}: Our data provide evidence for normal collagen gene expression in sun-damaged skin and suggest that degradation and remodeling of collagen take place in the papillary dermis accompanied by deposition of other matrix components, predominantly abnormal elastic fibers.},

This barrier function is mainly provided by the outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis. The epidermis is maintained by epidermal stem cells which reside in the basal layer and which generate daughter cells that move upwards towards the surface of the skin. During this journey, keratinocytes undergo a series of biochemical and morphological changes that result in the formation of the various layers of the epidermis. Eventually, these cells turn into the outermost layer of dead cornified cells that are sloughed into the environment. This review summarizes our current understanding of the mechanisms that control proliferation and differentiation of epidermal stem cells, and thus addresses fundamental processes that control epidermal morphogenesis and function.},

Outlined are diverse cosmeceutical activities, ranging from antioxidant effectiveness and anti-inflammatory potential to rejuvenating properties, ultraviolet radiation protection, and the brightening attributes inherent in natural extracts. Finally, we presented the contributions of metabolomics to the quality assessment of natural cosmetics ingredients by identification of bioactive compounds, dereplication of bio-sourced ingredients, quality and safety assessment of extracts, authentication, and traceability, and the detection of adulteration.

	abstract = {Oxidative stress in skin plays a major role in the aging process. This is true for intrinsic aging and even more for extrinsic aging. Although the results are quite different in dermis and epidermis, extrinsic aging is driven to a large extent by oxidative stress caused by {UV} irradiation. In this review the overall effects of oxidative stress are discussed as well as the sources of {ROS} including the mitochondrial {ETC}, peroxisomal and {ER} localized proteins, the Fenton reaction, and such enzymes as cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, xanthine oxidases, and {NADPH} oxidases. Furthermore, the defense mechanisms against oxidative stress ranging from enzymes like superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxiredoxins, and {GSH} peroxidases to organic compounds such as L-ascorbate, α-tocopherol, beta-carotene, uric acid, {CoQ}10, and glutathione are described in more detail. In addition the oxidative stress induced modifications caused to proteins, lipids and {DNA} are discussed. Finally age-related changes of the skin are also a topic of this review. They include a disruption of the epidermal calcium gradient in old skin with an accompanying change in the composition of the cornified envelope. This modified cornified envelope also leads to an altered anti-oxidative capacity and a reduced barrier function of the epidermis.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Green tea and green tea polyphenols have been shown to possess cancer preventive activities in preclinical model systems. In preparation for future green tea intervention trials, we have conducted a clinical study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of green tea polyphenols after 4 weeks of daily p.o. administration of epigallocatechin gallate ({EGCG}) or Polyphenon E (a defined, decaffeinated green tea polyphenol mixture). In an exploratory fashion, we have also determined the effect of chronic green tea polyphenol administration on {UV}-induced erythema response.Experimental Design: Healthy participants with Fitzpatric skin type {II} or {III} underwent a 2-week run-in period and were randomly assigned to receive one of the five treatments for 4 weeks: 800 mg {EGCG} once/day, 400 mg {EGCG} twice/day, 800 mg {EGCG} as Polyphenon E once/day, 400 mg {EGCG} as Polyphenon E twice/day, or a placebo once/day (8 subjects/group). Samples were collected and measurements performed before and after the 4-week treatment period for determination of safety, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity of green tea polyphenol treatment.Results: Adverse events reported during the 4-week treatment period include excess gas, upset stomach, nausea, heartburn, stomach ache, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, and muscle pain. All of the reported events were rated as mild events. For most events, the incidence reported in the polyphenol-treated groups was not more than that reported in the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in blood counts and blood chemistry profiles after repeated administration of green tea polyphenol products. There was a \&gt;60\% increase in the area under the plasma {EGCG} concentration-time curve after 4 weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at a dosing schedule of 800 mg once daily. No significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of {EGCG} after repeated green tea polyphenol treatment at a regimen of 400 mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetics of the conjugated metabolites of epigallocatechin and epicatechin were not affected by repeated green tea polyphenol treatment. Four weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at the selected dose and dosing schedule did not provide protection against {UV}-induced erythema.Conclusions: We conclude that it is safe for healthy individuals to take green tea polyphenol products in amounts equivalent to the {EGCG} content in 8–16 cups of green tea once a day or in divided doses twice a day for 4 weeks. There is a \&gt;60\% increase in the systemic availability of free {EGCG} after chronic green tea polyphenol administration at a high daily bolus dose (800 mg {EGCG} or Polyphenon E once daily).},

Research on this medicinal plant has been aimed at validating traditional uses and deepening the mechanism of action, identifying the compounds responsible for these activities. The most investigated active compounds are aloe-emodin, aloin, aloesin, emodin, and acemannan. Likewise, new actions have been investigated for Aloe vera and its active compounds. This review provides an overview of current pharmacological studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials), written in English during the last six years (2014-2019). In particular, new pharmacological data research has shown that most studies refer to anti-cancer action, skin and digestive protective activity, and antimicrobial properties. Most recent works are in vitro and in vivo. Clinical trials have been conducted just with Aloe vera, but not with isolated compounds; therefore, it would be interesting to study the clinical effect of relevant metabolites in different human conditions and pathologies. The promising results of these studies in basic research encourage a greater number of clinical trials to test the clinical application of Aloe vera and its main compounds, particularly on bone protection, cancer, and diabetes.},

This study aims to define the term "phytocosmetics" on the basis of official regulatory sources, assess the state of the literature on phytocosmetics, present examples of natural active ingredients and highlight the advantages and limitations of their use in cosmetics. The literature search was conducted in {PubMed}, Google Scholar and Science Direct, and revealed a relatively small number of articles on phytocosmetics despite the long-standing traditional use of plant ingredients. Although there is no official definition of phytocosmetic products, the term can be understood as cosmetic products containing components of plant origin. Examples of natural active ingredients with various benefits for the skin and hair were presented, focusing mainly on polyphenols and flavonoids. Phytocosmetic products offer advantages over synthetic chemicals, including avoiding endocrine disruption and promoting sustainability through the use of agricultural waste. However, barriers such as the low bioavailability and chemical instability of some plant ingredients require innovative delivery systems, and the use of organic solvents can be mitigated by environmentally friendly extraction techniques. Specific regulatory guidelines for phytocosmetic products are lacking, requiring the establishment of science-based quality and safety standards. Further research is needed to understand the potential adverse effects and mechanisms of action of plant-derived ingredients on the skin.},

	abstract = {Identification of natural products capable of affording protection against {UVB} radiation-induced inflammatory responses and generation of oxidative stress may have important human health implications. The {UVB} exposure-induced skin injury and oxidative stress has been associated with a variety of skin disease conditions including photoaging, inflammation and cancer. Tea is a popular beverage consumed worldwide. In several mouse skin models, topical application as well as oral consumption of green tea has been shown to afford protection against chemical and {UVB}-induced carcinogenesis and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we investigated in human skin, whether topical application of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}), the major polyphenolic constituent in green tea, inhibits {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes (macrophage/neutrophils), a potential source of generation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}), and generation of prostaglandin ({PG}) metabolites. Human subjects were {UVB} irradiated on sun-protected skin to four times their minimal erythema dosage ({MED}) and skin biopsies or keratomes were obtained either 24 h or 48 h later. We found that topical application of {EGCG} (3 mg/2.5 cm2) before {UVB} (4 {MED}) exposure to human skin significantly blocked {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes and reduced myeloperoxidase activity. These infiltrating leukocytes are considered to be the major source of generation of {ROS}. In the same set of experiments we found that topical application of {EGCG} before {UVB} exposure decreased {UVB}-induced erythema. In additional experiments, we found that microsomes from {EGCG} pretreated human skin and exposed to {UVB}, compared to {UVB} exposure alone, produced significantly reduced {PG} metabolites, particularly {PGE}2. The {PG} metabolites play a critical role in free radical generation and skin tumor promotion in multistage skin carcinogenesis. Careful microscopic examination of skin sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, under higher magnification (x400) also revealed that {EGCG} pretreated and {UVB}-exposed human skin contained fewer dead cells in the epidermis with comparison to nonpretreated {UVB}-exposed skin. Taken together, our data demonstrate that {EGCG} has the potential to block the {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes and the subsequent generation of {ROS} in human skin. This may explain the possible mechanism involved in anti-inflammatory effects of green tea. We suggest that {EGCG} may be useful as a topical agent for protection against {UVB}-induced {ROS}-associated inflammatory dermatoses, photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. Further studies are warranted in this direction.},

	abstract = {Acne is a highly prevalent inflammatory skin condition involving sebaceous sties. Although it clearly develops from an interplay of multiple factors, the exact cause of acne remains elusive. It is increasingly believed that the interaction between skin microbes and host immunity plays an important role in this disease, with perturbed microbial composition and activity found in acne patients. Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes; formerly called Propionibacterium acnes) is commonly found in sebum-rich areas and its over-proliferation has long been thought to contribute to the disease. However, information provided by advanced metagenomic sequencing has indicated that the cutaneous microbiota in acne patients and acne-free individuals differ at the virulent-specific lineage level. Acne also has close connections with the gastrointestinal tract, and many argue that the gut microbiota could be involved in the pathogenic process of acne. The emotions of stress (e.g., depression and anxiety), for instance, have been hypothesized to aggravate acne by altering the gut microbiota and increasing intestinal permeability, potentially contributing to skin inflammation. Over the years, an expanding body of research has highlighted the presence of a gut–brain–skin axis that connects gut microbes, oral probiotics, and diet, currently an area of intense scrutiny, to acne severity. This review concentrates on the skin and gut microbes in acne, the role that the gut–brain–skin axis plays in the immunobiology of acne, and newly emerging microbiome-based therapies that can be applied to treat acne.},

Results revealed that the total phenolic acid and oligosaccharide content in {HSE} was {\textgreater}50\%. {HSE} had a stronger preventive effect on {UVR}-induced injury than the repair effect. Moreover, phenolic acids were the main active component of {HSE} mediating the preventative effect.

In addition, {HSE} inhibited the expression of various {mRNA} kinases in the {MAPK}-{ERK}/p38/{JNK} pathway. This downregulated the expression of activator protein-1 ({AP}-1) {mRNA} and further reduced the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase ({MMP})-1, {MMP}-3, and {MMP}-9 as well as reduced {UVR}-induced injury to the cells.

              Background and Objective
              Deep coagulation of skin collagen by Er:{YAG} laser repetitive pulses has been predicted by previous theoretical models and later demonstrated on animal skin. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of repetitive Er:{YAG} laser pulses on human skin and its response to this treatment.
            
            
              Study Design/Materials and Methods
              
                Lid skin of six female volunteers with blepharochalasis has been treated with laser at day 0, 7, and 21 before elective surgery—blepharoplasty. The treated skin was excised as part of the procedure and prepared for further histological examination. We used a 2,940 nm Er:{YAG} laser (Fidelis M320A by Fotona) with ‘smooth’ mode parameters: fluence from 0.50 to 2.00 J/cm
                2
                ; six pulses per packet; 550 μsecond/pulse, 250 millisecond/packet; single pass, no overlapping; spot size 5 mm; repetition rate 20 Hz.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                We observed deep collagen denaturation at laser fluences of 1.25 J/cm
                2
                and over; epidermal damage was proportional to fluence with total coagulation of the epidermal layer at fluences of 1.75 J/cm
                2
                and over. At day 7 after laser treatment we observed a complete regeneration of the epidermal layer and a regeneration zone within the dermis with prominent infiltration of {CD}68+ monocytes/macrophages. At day 21 after laser treatment we observed collagen remodeling and (myo‐)fibroblast proliferation at tissue depths of up to 240 μm.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Repetitive Er:{YAG} laser irradiation is effective in deep denaturation and remodeling of human skin collagen in vivo, with less epidermal damage compared to standard Er:{YAG} laser skin resurfacing. Lasers Surg. Med. 35:146–151, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

It was suggested that air pollution is a trigger factor for sensitive skin ({SS}).

Reconstructed human epidermis ({RHE}, Episkin®) was exposed to {PM} and subsequently the supernatants were transferred to a culture of {PC}12 cells differentiated into sensory neurons ({SN}). Cell viability, axonal growth and neuropeptide-release were measured. The modulation of the expression of different inflammatory, keratinocytes differentiation and neurites growth markers was assessed. {PM} samples contained a high proportion of particles with a size below 1 μm and a complex chemical composition. Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that {PM} altered keratinocytes terminal differentiation and induced an inflammatory response. While viability and functionality of the {SN} were not modified, their outgrowth was significantly decreased after incubation with {PM}-exposed Episkin® supernatants. This was closely related to the modification of nerve growth factor/semaphorin 3A balance. This study showed that air pollutants have negative effects on keratinocytes and sensory nerve endings including inflammatory responses. These effects are probably involved in the {SS} pathophysiology and might be involved in inflammatory skin disorders.},

The pathophysiological model of rosacea involves an unbalanced immune system predisposed to excessive inflammation, in addition to vascular and nervous alterations, being certain cutaneous microorganisms’ triggers of the symptoms onset. The gut-skin axis explains a bidirectional interaction between skin and gut microbiota in some inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or rosacea. The introduction and consolidation of the next-generation sequencing in recent years has provided unprecedented information about the microbiome. However, the characterization of the gut and skin microbiota and the impact of the gut-skin axis in patients with rosacea has been little explored, in contrast to other inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Furthermore, the clinical evolution of patients with rosacea is not always adequate and it is common for them to present a sustained symptomatology with frequent flare-ups. In this context, probiotic supplementation could improve the clinical evolution of these patients as happens in other pathologies. Through this review we aim to establish and compile the basics and directions of current knowledge to understand the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences the pathogenesis of rosacea, and how modulation of the skin and gut microbiota could benefit these patients.},

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) are necessary for normal cell signaling and the antimicrobial defense of the skin. However excess production of {ROS} can disrupt the cellular redox balance and overwhelm the cellular antioxidant ({AO}) capacity, leading to oxidative stress. In the skin, oxidative stress plays a key role in driving both extrinsic and intrinsic aging. Sunlight exposure has also been a major contributor to extrinsic photoaging of the skin as its oxidising components disrupt both redox- and iron-homeostasis, promoting oxidative damage to skin cells and tissue constituents. Upon oxidative insults, the interplay between excess accumulation of {ROS} and redox-active labile iron ({LI}) and its detrimental consequences to the skin are often overlooked. In this review we have revisited the oxidative mechanisms underlying skin damage and aging by focussing on the concerted action of {ROS} and redox-active {LI} in the initiation and progression of intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging processes. Based on these, we propose to redefine the selection criteria for skin antiaging and photoprotective ingredients to include natural antioxidants ({AOs}) exhibiting robust redox-balancing and/or iron-chelating properties. This would promote the concept of natural-based or bio-inspired bifunctional anti-aging and photoprotective ingredients for skincare and sunscreen formulations with both {AO} and iron-chelating properties.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We performed an extensive search in the {PubMed} and Google Scholar databases. We included peer-reviewed studies in {SOC} populations around the world regarding one or more of the skin aging exposome factors, and we grouped and organized the studies under each factor of the skin aging exposome.
{RESULTS}: Some environmental exposome factors are preventable or modifiable, for example, by applying broad-spectrum sunscreens with visible light protection, improving nutrition, and smoking cessation. Other factors such as air pollution will require more complex solutions. Our search revealed a paucity of references on skin aging exposome factors in {SOC} populations.

Intrinsic aging is associated with programmed aging and cellular senescence, which are caused by endogenous oxidative stress and cellular damage. Extrinsic aging is the result of environmental factors, such as ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation and pollution, and leads to the production of reactive oxygen species, ultimately causing {DNA} damage and cellular dysfunction. In aged skin, senescent cells accumulate and contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, which further contributes to the aging process. To combat the symptoms of aging, various topical agents and clinical procedures such as chemical peels, injectables, and energy-based devices have been developed. These procedures address different symptoms of aging, but to devise an effective anti-aging treatment protocol, it is essential to thoroughly understand the mechanisms of skin aging.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Microbial dysbiosis with increased Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonization on the skin is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis ({AD}), however most microbiome studies focus on bacteria in the flexures and the microbial composition at other body sites have not been studied systematically.
{OBJECTIVES}: The aim of the study is to characterize the skin microbiome, including bacteria, fungi and virus, at different body sites in relation to {AD}, lesional state, and S. aureus colonization, and to test whether the nares could be a reservoir for S. aureus strain colonization.
{METHODS}: Using shotgun metagenomics we characterized microbial compositions from 14 well defined skin sites from 10 patients with {AD} and 5 healthy controls.
{RESULTS}: We found clear differences in microbial composition between {AD} and controls at multiple skin sites, most pronounced on the flexures and neck. The flexures exhibited lower alpha-diversity and were colonized by S. aureus, accompanied by S. epidermidis in lesions. Malassezia species were absent on the neck in {AD}. Virus mostly constituted Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus phages, with increased abundance of Propionibacterium phages {PHL}041 and {PHL}092 and Staphylococcus epidermidis phages {CNPH}82 and {PH}15 in {AD}. In lesional samples, both the genus Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus phages were more abundant. S. aureus abundance was higher across all skin sites except from the feet. In samples where S. aureus was highly abundant, lower abundances of S. hominis and Cutibacterium acnes were observed. M. osloensis and M. luteus were more abundant in {AD}. By single nucleotide variant analysis of S. aureus we found strains to be subject specific. On skin sites some S. aureus strains were similar and some dissimilar to the ones in the nares.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our data indicate a global and site-specific dysbiosis in {AD}, involving both bacteria, fungus and virus. When defining targeted treatment clinicians should both consider the individual and skin site and future research into potential crosstalk between microbiota in {AD} yields high potential.},

Several microbes are associated with {AD} pathogenesis, with proposed pathogenic effects from S. aureus and Malassezia. The complex relationships between microbes within the skin microbiome consortia includes various species, such as Staphylococcal, Roseomonas and Cutibacterium strains, that can inhibit S. aureus and are potential probiotics for {AD} skin.

	abstract = {Significance: The skin is a complex and dynamic organ that performs several vital functions. The maturation process of the skin starts at birth with the adaption of the skin to the comparatively dry environment compared to the in utero milieu. This adaptive flexibility results in the unique properties of infant skin. To deliver appropriate care to infant skin, it is necessary to understand that it is evolving with unique characteristics., Recent Advances: The role of biophysical noninvasive techniques in the assessment of skin development underlines the importance of an objective evaluation of skin physiology parameters. Skin hydration, transepidermal water loss, and {pH} values are measurable with specific instruments that give us an accurate and reproducible assessment during infant skin maturation. The recording of these values, following standard measurement procedures, allows us to evaluate the integrity of the skin barrier and to monitor the functionality of the maturing skin over time., Critical Issues: During the barrier development, impaired skin function makes the skin vulnerable to chemical damage, microbial infections, and skin diseases, possibly compromising the general health of the infant. Preterm newborns, during the first weeks of life, have an even less developed skin barrier and, therefore, are even more at risk. Thus, it is extremely important to evaluate the risk of infection, skin breakdown, topical agent absorption, and the risk of thermoregulation failure., Future Directions: Detailed and objective evaluations of infant skin maturation are necessary to improve infant skin care. The results of these evaluations should be formed into general protocols that will allow doctors and caregivers to give more personalized care to full-term newborns, preterm newborns, and infants.},

	abstract = {This review analyses whether skin temperature represents ambient temperature and serves as a feedforward signal for the thermoregulation system, or whether it is one of the body's temperatures and provides feedback. The body is covered mostly by hairy (non‐glabrous) skin, which is typically insulated from the environment (with clothes in humans and with fur in non‐human mammals). Thermal signals from hairy skin represent a temperature of the insulated superficial layer of the body and provide feedback to the thermoregulation system. It is explained that this feedback is auxiliary, both negative and positive, and that it reduces the system's response time and load error. Non‐hairy (glabrous) skin covers specialized heat‐exchange organs (e.g. the hand), which are also used to explore the environment. In thermoregulation, these organs are primarily effectors. Their main thermosensory‐related role is to assess local temperatures of objects explored; these local temperatures are feedforward signals for various behaviours. Non‐hairy skin also contributes to the feedback for thermoregulation, but this contribution is limited. Autonomic (physiological) thermoregulation does not use feedforward signals. Thermoregulatory behaviours use both feedback and feedforward signals. Implications of these principles to thermopharmacology, a new approach to achieving biological effects by blocking temperature signals with drugs, are discussed.},

Evidence is provided that {UVB} irradiation of isolated {DNA} in aqueous solutions and in cells gives rise to the predominant generation of cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers ({CPDs}) and, to a lesser extent, of pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs), the importance of which is strongly primary sequence dependent. A notable change in the photoproduct distribution is observed when {DNA} either in the dry or in desiccated microorganisms is exposed to {UVC} or {UVB} photons with an overwhelming formation of 5-(α-thymidyl)-5,6-dihydrothymidine, also called spore photoproduct ({dSP}), at the expense of {CPDs} and 6-4PPs. {UVA} irradiation of isolated and cellular {DNA} gives rise predominantly to bipyrimidine photoproducts with the overwhelming formation of thymine-containing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers at the exclusion of 6-4PPs. {UVA} photons have been shown to modulate the distribution of {UVB} dimeric pyrimidine photoproducts by triggering isomerization of the 6-4PPs into related Dewar valence isomers. Mechanistic aspects of the formation of bipyrimidine photoproducts are discussed in the light of recent photophysical and theoretical studies.},

	abstract = {The skin is the largest organ in the body and plays several essential functions acting as a barrier that protects us from physical and chemical insults, prevents the entrance of pathogens and the loss of water, besides playing an esential role in the regulation of body temperature. The skin displays a high regenerative capacity, evidenced by its self-renewing activity and the process of wound healing, driven by the existence of several resident stem cell populations. Due to the high prevalence of skin pathology, and their anatomical accessibility, skin biopsies and their subsequent microscopic observation constitute a powerfull tool for the study of primary skin diseases, as well as cutaneous manifestations of systemic diseases. This gave rise to dermatopathology as a specific discipline that unifies dermatology and pathology. In this setting, staining with hematoxylin and eosin constitutes the gold standard method for microscopic observation and diagnosis. Yet, several additional stains are used for specific purposes, such as trichrome stains for the staining of collagens in the extracellular matrix. We have applied a recently developed stain ({RGB} trichrome, acronym for picrosirius Red, fast Green and alcian Blue) to human samples to assess the staining outcomes in normal skin tissues. {RGB} staining provides a high contrasted interface between epidermis and dermis, and a comprehensible staining of the different dermal structures such as blood vessels, nerves, and sweat and sebaceous glands. The specific staining of collagens by picrosirius red can be useful for the objective quantification of these proteins under polarized light microscopy. In hair follicles, {RGB} staining resulted in specific staining of the epidermal sheaths and the encasing connective tissue (i.e., dermal sheath). Interestingly, the dermal sheath show two domains in which blue predominates over red staining, thus indicating that proteoglycans prevail in these areas. These two zones are the dermal papilla and an uncharacterized zone located at the upper isthmus, that we have denominated as proteoglycan-enriched belt ({PEB}). While the role of the papilla in the induction and regulation of hair growth is clearly established, the possible role of {PEB} remains to be determined and merits additional investigation.},

Topical applications of basic skin care products seem to reduce skin tear incidence. The suction blister method leads to the artificial and controlled separation of dermis and epidermis. Therefore, time to blister formation may be used as outcome measuring the strength of dermo‐epidermal adhesion. We conducted an exploratory, randomised, controlled trial with a split‐body design on forearms in healthy female subjects (n = 12; mean age 70.3 [{SD} 2.1] years). Forearms assigned to the intervention were treated twice daily with petrolatum for 8 weeks. Suction blisters were induced on forearms after 4 and 8 weeks and time to blister formation was measured. Stratum corneum and epidermal hydration were measured and epidermal thickness was assessed via optical coherence tomography. Time to blistering was longer and stratum corneum as well as epidermal hydration was consistently higher in intervention skin areas. We conclude that topical application of basic skin care products may improve mechanical adhesion of the dermo‐epidermal junction and that the parameter “time to blistering” is a suitable outcome to measure dermo‐epidermal adhesion strength in clinical research.},

	abstract = {The time at which human diploid cell strains can be expected to cease dividing in vitro (Phase {III}) is not a function of the number of subcultivations but rather of the number of potential cell doublings. Each clonable cell within the population is endowed with the same doubling potential (50 ±10). Cells of the same strain, but with different “doubling potentials”, were mixed. Phase {III} in such mixed populations occurs at that time when the “youngest” cell component is expected to reach Phase {III}. The “older” component has no effect on the time at which Phase {III} is expected to take place in the “younger” component. An ancillary conclusion that Phase {III} cannot be explained by the presence of a latent virus, mycoplasma or media composition is confirmed. Human diploid cell strains derived from adult lung have a significantly lower doubling potential in vitro than do fetal strains. The Phase {III} phenomenon may be related to senescence in vivo. The cellular theory of aging must be related to normal cells in vitro and not to heteroploid cell lines. The former have a finite period of multiplication; the latter are indefinitely cultivable. In vivo experiments also indicate that transplanted normal tissue has a finite lifetime. Chromosome anomalies occurring in Phase {III} may be related to such anomalies occurring in the cells of older animals, including man. The survival curves obtained with human diploid cell strains are comparable to “multiple-hit” or “multiple-target” curves obtained with other biological systems where an initial threshold dose is required before an exponential form of the curve is established. Whatever cell component(s) may be involved in the finite lifetime of human diploid cell strains, the ultimate accumulation of nondividing cells could be the result of accumulated damage to a single cellular target or to inactivation of many targets.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of damage is generally considered the cause of aging. Interventions that delay aging mobilize mechanisms that protect and repair cellular components. Consequently, research has been focused on studying the protective and homeostatic mechanisms within cells. However, in humans and other multicellular organisms, cells are surrounded by extracellular matrices ({ECMs}), which are important for tissue structure, function, and intercellular communication. During aging, components of the {ECM} become damaged through fragmentation, glycation, crosslinking, and accumulation of protein aggregation, all of which contribute to age-related pathologies. Interestingly, placing senescent cells into a young {ECM} rejuvenates them. Furthermore, we found that many longevity-assurances pathways reactivate de novo synthesis of {ECM} proteins during aging. This raises the question of what constitutes a young {ECM} to reverse aging or maintain health? In order to make inroads to answering this question, I suggest a systems-level approach of quantifying the matrisome or {ECM} compositions reflecting health, pathology, or phenotype and propose a novel term, the "matreotype," to describe this. The matreotype is defined as the composition and modification of {ECM} or matrisome proteins associated with or caused by a phenotype, such as longevity, or a distinct and acute physiological state, as observed during aging or disease. Every cell type produces its unique {ECM}. Intriguingly, cancer-cell types can even be identified based on their unique {ECM} composition. Thus, the matreotype reflects cellular identity and physiological status. Defined matreotypes could be used as biomarkers or prognostic factors for disease or health status during aging with potential relevance for personalized medicine. Treatment with biologics that alter {ECM}-to-cell mechanotransduction might be a strategy to reverse age-associated pathologies. An understanding of how to reverse from an old to a young matreotype might point toward novel strategies to rejuvenate cells and help maintain tissue homeostasis to promote health during aging.},

Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes, formerly named Propionibacterium acnes) is recognized as a key factor in acne development, regulating inflammatory and immune pathways. Dysbiosis has been described as the imbalance in skin microbiome homeostasis and may play a role in acne pathogenesis. Microbial interference has been shown to be a contributor to healthy skin homeostasis and staphylococcal strains may exclude acne-associated C. acnes phylotypes. In this review we present an update on the skin microbiome in acne and discuss how current acne treatments such as benzoyl peroxide, orally administered isotretinoin, and antibiotics may affect the skin microbiome homeostasis. We highlight the collateral damage of acne antibiotics on the skin microbiome, including the risk of antimicrobial resistance and the dysregulation of the microbiome equilibrium that may occur even with short-term antibiotic courses. Consequently, the interest is shifting towards new non-antibiotic pharmacological acne treatments. Orally administered spironolactone is an emerging off-label treatment for adult female patients and topical peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ({PPARγ}) modulation is being studied for patients with acne. The potential application of topical or oral probiotics, bacteriotherapy, and phage therapy for acne are further promising areas of future research.},

Many consumers choose “green cosmetics”, which are environmentally friendly creams, makeup, and beauty products, hoping that they are not harmful to health and reduce pollution. Moreover, the repeated mini-lock downs during the {COVID}-19 pandemic have fueled the awareness that body beauty is linked to well-being, both external and internal. As a result, consumer preferences for makeup have declined, while those for skincare products have increased. Nutricosmetics, which combines the benefits derived from food supplementation with the advantages of cosmetic treatments to improve the beauty of our body, respond to the new market demands. Food chemistry and cosmetic chemistry come together to promote both inside and outside well-being. A nutricosmetic optimizes the intake of nutritional microelements to meet the needs of the skin and skin appendages, improving their conditions and delaying aging, thus helping to protect the skin from the aging action of environmental factors. Numerous studies in the literature show a significant correlation between the adequate intake of these supplements, improved skin quality (both aesthetic and histological), and the acceleration of wound-healing.

It has been traditionally believed that skin pigmentation is the most important photoprotective factor, as melanin, besides functioning as a broadband {UV} absorbent, has antioxidant and radical scavenging properties. Besides, many epidemiological studies have shown a lower incidence for skin cancer in individuals with darker skin compared to those with fair skin. Skin pigmentation is of great cultural and cosmetic importance, yet the role of melanin in photoprotection is still controversial. This article outlines the major acute and chronic effects of {UVR} on human skin, the properties of melanin, the regulation of pigmentation and its effect on skin cancer prevention.},

Current exposome research aims to understand the effects all factors have on specific organs, yet today, the exposome of human skin has not received major attention and a corresponding definition is lacking. This review was compiled with the collaboration of European scientists, specialized in either environmental medicine or skin biology. A comprehensive review of the existing literature was performed using {PubMed}. The search was restricted to exposome factors and skin aging. Key review papers and all relevant, epidemiological, in vitro, ex vivo and clinical studies were analyzed to determine the key elements of the exposome influencing skin aging. Here we propose a definition of the skin aging exposome. It is based on a summary of the existing scientific evidence for the role of exposome factors in skin aging. We also identify future research needs which concern knowledge about the interaction of distinct exposomal factors with each other and the resulting net effects on skin aging and suggest some protective measures.},

While it is predominantly observed in adolescents, it can affect individuals across all age groups. Acne pathogenesis is believed to be a result of various endogenous and exogenous factors, but the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Recent studies suggest that dysbiosis of the skin microbiota significantly contributes to acne development. Specifically, Cutibacterium acnes, the dominant resident bacterial species implicated in acne, plays a critical role in disease progression. Various treatments, including topical benzoyl peroxide, systemic antibiotics, and photodynamic therapy, have demonstrated beneficial effects on the skin microbiota composition in acne patients. Of particular interest is the therapeutic potential of probiotics in acne, given its direct influence on the skin microbiota. This review summarizes the alterations in skin microbiota associated with acne, provides insight into its pathogenic role in acne, and emphasizes the potential of therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring microbial homeostasis for acne management.},

Plants give us a distinct class of natural compounds, commonly called secondary metabolites and better examples are the flavonoids, phenols, terpenoids, alkaloids, tannins, and carotenoids. Plant derived phytoproducts have been used for the treatment of human disorders in both traditional as well as modern medicine. Naturally occurring aporphines and their synthetic derivatives are well known in medicine for their pharmacological activities, including an affinity for dopaminergic, adrenergic and serotonergic receptors. (+)-nantenine is an aporphine alkaloid isolated from Nandina domestica and other plants. The aim of the present study is to analyze the biological potential and therapeutic effectiveness of nantenine in medicine. In the present work scientific information of nantenine for their medicinal uses and pharmacological activities have been collected from scientific databases such as Google, Google Scholar, {PubMed}, Scopus, and Science Direct . Scientific information of nantenine was further analyzed to know their health beneficial aspects in medicine. However, the detail pharmacological activity of nantenine has been discussed in the present work with its analytical aspects. Scientific data analysis described the medicinal importance and pharmacological activities of nantenine. Nantenine revealed adrenergic response, behavioral response, cardiovascular effect, vasorelaxant effect, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory potential, cytotoxicity, and biphasic tracheal relaxation. Present work also signified the biological potential of nantenine for their anti-inflammatory activity, anticonvulsant effect, antiserotonergic activities, anti-{MDMA} effect, antileishmanial activity, effect on histamine and serotonin, human 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-{HT}(2A)) and h5-{HT}(2B) receptors and isolated tissues. Further, the analytical techniques used for the separation, isolation and identification of nantenine have also been described in this work.

It aims to identify the main trajectories of the cosmetics market and thoroughly explore their potential impact on future marketing strategies. The methodologies used in this study include statistical analysis to decipher market dynamics and forecasts, an in-depth literature review to track market narratives, and a comparative approach to understand the relative impact of each trend. Digging deeper into the results, a major trend was the focus on transparency and clarity of product ingredients. Consumers are leaning towards brands that demonstrate unambiguous ingredient lists and transparent sourcing and production practices. The second key trend is the rapid integration of artificial intelligence and big data technologies into cosmetic marketing. Brands are using {AI}-powered tools to provide personalised product recommendations, predictive marketing, and improve customer experience. In addition, the previously ignored male demographic is becoming a focus, requiring products and marketing campaigns tailored to male sensibilities and needs. The surge in demand for multifunctional cosmetic products, i.e., those that combine multiple benefits, highlights the fourth trend. Consumers are now gravitating towards products that offer multiple benefits by combining skincare and cosmetic benefits. Ultimately, brand loyalty, underpinned by ethical and sustainable practices, is seen as the linchpin of future marketing strategies. The practical implications of this research are multifaceted. For companies operating in the cosmetics market, understanding these trends is not only useful, but also necessary to adapt their strategies to keep them in sync with consumer expectations and ongoing market changes.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To assess individual time-related (time-stamped) {UV} radiation ({UVR}) dose pattern and sun exposure behavior.
{DESIGN}: Open prospective observational study.
{SETTING}: University hospital. Study Subjects Two hundred eighty-five Danish volunteers with apparently healthy skin: children, adolescents, indoor workers, sun worshippers, golfers, and gardeners (age range, 4-68 years). Measurements We developed a personal electronic {UVR} dosimeter in a wristwatch ({SunSaver}) and measured continuously time-related {UVR} doses in standard erythema dose ({SED}) and corresponding sun exposure behavior from diaries, resulting in 346 sun-years (median, 119 days). The estimated yearly {UVR} doses were calculated based on personal and ambient measured doses.
{RESULTS}: The median estimated yearly {UVR} dose was 173 {SEDs} (range, 132 {SEDs} [indoor workers]-224 {SEDs} [gardeners]), with no significant difference by age (P =.25) or sex (P =.75). The {SED} of girls (175 {SEDs}) was significantly (P =.04) higher than that of boys (116 {SEDs}). Subjects younger than 20 years had an increase of 5 {SEDs} per year (P =.03). Sunbathing or exposing shoulders (risk behavior) outside the beach resulted in a median of 2.5 {SEDs} per day in northern Europe and 3.2 {SEDs} per day in southern Europe; however, at the beach, corresponding values were 4.6 and 6.9 {SEDs} per day. Children and adolescents received more than half their total {UVR} dose at the beach. Sunburning doses above 10 {SEDs} per day were connected with sunbathing or exposing shoulders. Of the {UVR} dose, 50\% was received between noon and 3 {PM}. Only the gardeners received most of their {UVR} dose (55\%) on working days.
{CONCLUSIONS}: High {UVR} doses are connected with risk behavior, except for outdoor workers. There is no need to change sun exposure habits on days without risk behavior.},

	volume = {16},
	issn = {1107-3756},
	abstract = {Ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation from the sun is widely considered as a major cause of human skin photoaging and skin cancer. {UV} radiation-induced proinflammatory cytokines mediated by {NF}-{kappaB} reportedly play important roles in photoaging and cancer. {NF}-{kappaB} and cytokines have been thus perceived as molecular targets for pharmacological intervention. With an increasing amount of knowledge of the actions of green tea extracts at cellular and molecular levels, the beneficial effect of drinking green tea has become well recognized if not completely accepted. The components in green tea have even been added to skin-care products unregulated, while the molecular mechanisms of the actions of those components on human skin are being unraveled. Using cultured human keratinocytes, we investigated the effects of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}), a major polyphenolic constituent in green tea, on {UV}-induced activation of transcription factor {NF}-{kappaB} and proinflammatory pathway by measuring nuclear translocation of {NF}-{kappaB} and {IL}-6 secretion in vitro. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis and {ELISA} indicated that both nuclear p65 and secreted {IL}-6 were significantly (p{\textless}0.05) induced by {UVB} (20, 30 {mJ}/cm2) and {UVA} irradiation (10, 20 J/cm2). {NF}-{kappaB} nuclear translocation and {IL}-6 secretion induced by {UVB} and {UVA} were dramatically inhibited by treatment of {EGCG}. {FACS} analysis showed that {EGCG} also inhibited {UVB}-induced apoptosis. {EGCG} recovered {UV}-induced loss of anti-apoptotic component, bcl-2, and inhibited {UV}-induced apoptotic component, Fas ligand, expression. Collectively, we conclude that {EGCG} inhibits {UVB}- and {UVA}-induced proinflammatory pathway and inhibits apoptosis in cultured human keratinocytes in vitro. Our data suggest that {EGCG} be added to cosmetic or skin-care products for prevention from {UV}-induced skin photoaging if this activity can be further confirmed and no cytotoxicity is reported in human skin in vivo.},

	shorttitle = {Vitamin D and the skin},
	abstract = {The keratinocytes of the skin are unique in being not only the primary source of vitamin D for the body, but in possessing both the enzymatic machinery to metabolize the vitamin D produced to active metabolites (in particular 1,25({OH})2D) and the vitamin D receptor ({VDR}) that enables the keratinocytes to respond to the 1,25({OH})2D thus generated. Numerous functions of the skin are regulated by vitamin D and/or its receptor. These include inhibition of proliferation, stimulation of differentiation including formation of the permeability barrier, promotion of innate immunity, regulation of the hair follicle cycle, and suppression of tumor formation. Regulation of these actions is exerted by a number of different coregulator complexes including the coactivators vitamin D receptor interacting protein ({DRIP}) complex also known as Mediator and the steroid receptor coactivator ({SRC}) family (of which {SRC} 2 and 3 are found in keratincytes), the inhibitor hairless (Hr), and β-catenin whose impact on {VDR} function is complex. Different coregulators appear to be involved in different {VDR} regulated functions. This review will examine the various functions of vitamin D and its receptor in the skin, and explore the mechanisms by which these functions are regulated.},

	abstract = {The weighted arithmetic mean is similar to an ordinary arithmetic mean (the most common type of average), except that instead of each of the data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points contribute more than others. The notion of weighted mean plays a role in descriptive statistics and also occurs in a more general form in several other areas of mathematics.
If all the weights are equal, then the weighted mean is the same as the arithmetic mean.  While weighted means generally behave in a similar fashion to arithmetic means, they do have a few counterintuitive properties, as captured for instance in Simpson's paradox.},
