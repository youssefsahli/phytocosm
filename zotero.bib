	abstract = {The licorice (Radix Glycyrrhizae or Liquiritiae radix), which is broadly used in medicine and commerce, is derived from the sweet root of various species of Glycyrrhiza (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., Glycyrrhiza glabra L., or Glycyrrhiza inflata Bat., Leguminosae). Licorice is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia; it is one of the most commonly used herbal medicines and an important source of confectionery (Fiore et al., 2005). Therefore the health properties associated with licorice are well documented. According to the World Health Organization, licorice is employed as a demulcent in the treatment of sore throats and an expectorant for coughs and bronchial catarrh. Licorice also has a critical role in the prophylaxis and treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers as well as dyspepsia. As an antiinflammatory agent, licorice reduces allergic reactions and prevents liver toxicity. In China, licorice is also documented to be effective for fatigue and debilitation (China, 2015). In this chapter, active components, extractions or preparations of liquorice in the medical use included protection of the nervous, endocrine, respiratory, digestive and cardiovascular systems that are supported by experimental or clinical data will be summarized.},

Physical and chemical analyses of crude oils extracted from the seeds by a cold solvent method were also performed. The following results (on a dry-weight basis) were obtained for Tunisian and Iranian varieties, respectively: protein 26.7\% and 22.6\%, oil 28.48\% and 40.35\%, ash 4.86\% and 4.41\%, and total carbohydrate 40.0\% and 32.7\%. The major unsaturated fatty acids were linoleic acid (50.3–49.2\%), followed by oleic acid (25.0–23.7\%), while the main saturated fatty acid was palmitic acid (17.2–18.4\%). Myristic, myristoleic, palmitoleic, margaric, margaroleic, stearic, linolenic, arachidic, eicosenoic, behenic and lignoceric acids were also detected. Thermal profiles of both Nigella seed varieties, determined by their {DSC} melting curves, revealed different thermograms. Sensorial profiles of Tunisian and Iranian seed oils were defined through the {CieLab} (L∗, a∗, b∗) colour, oxidative stability by Rancimat test and viscosity. Physicochemical properties of the oils for Tunisian and Iranian varieties, respectively, include: saponification number 211 and 217, peroxide value 5.65 and 4.35, iodine index 120 and 101, and an acidity of 22.7\% and 18.6\%. Results suggested that Nigella seed oil could deserve further consideration and investigation as a potential new multi-purpose product for industrial, cosmetic and pharmaceutical uses.},

	abstract = {The use of polymeric surfactants for the stabilization of cosmetic and personal care formulations is described in terms of their adsorption and conformation at the solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interface. The most eﬀective polymeric surfactants are the A–B, A–B–A block and {BAn} or {ABn} graft types (where B is the anchor chain and A is the stabilizing chain). The mechanism by which these polymeric surfactants stabiles suspensions and emulsions is brieﬂy discussed in terms of their interaction when particles or droplets approach. This provides very strong repulsion, which is referred to as steric stabilization. Particular attention is given to a recently developed graft copolymer {ABn} based on inulin (which is extracted from chicory roots) that is hydrophobized by grafting several alkyl groups (B) onto the linear polyfructose chain (A). This polymeric surfactant is referred to as hydrophobically modiﬁed inulin ({HMI}) and is commercially available as {INUTEC}2 {SP}1 ({ORAFTI}, Belgium). It is used for the stabilization of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions both in aqueous media and in the presence of high electrolyte concentrations. The emulsions remained stable for more than one year at room temperature and at 50 8C. {INUTEC}2 {SP}1 is also eﬀective in reducing Ostwald ripening in nano-emulsions. It could also be applied for the preparation of W/O/W and O/W/O multiple emulsions and for stabilization of liposomes and vesicles. Based on these fundamental studies, {INUTEC}2 {SP}1 could be applied for the preparation of stable personal care formulations. The amount of polymeric surfactant required for maintenance of stability (for more than one year at ambient temperature) was relatively low (of the order of 1 w/w\% based on the oil phase). In addition, the polymeric surfactant showed no skin irritation, no stickiness or greasiness and it gave an excellent skin-feel.},

The activity of retinoids is thought to be mediated by interactions with two subfamilies of nuclear retinoic acid receptors, {RAR} and {RXR}. The {RARs} bind all-trans retinoic acid (t-{RA}) with high affinity and alter gene expression as a consequence of this direct ligand interaction. {RXR} alpha is activated by t-{RA}, yet has little binding affinity for this ligand. t-{RA} may be converted to a more proximate ligand that directly binds and activates {RXR} alpha, and we have developed a method of nuclear receptor-dependent ligand trapping to test this hypothesis. Here we report the identification of a stereoisomer of retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, which directly binds and activates {RXR} alpha.

	abstract = {Traditional Chinese Medicine ({TCM}) consists of a plethora of therapeutic approaches aiming to both characterize and treat diseases. Its utilization has gained significant popularity in the western world and is even backed by the World Health Organization’s decision to include {TCM} diagnostic patterns into the new revision of the International Classification of Diseases code, the global standard for diagnostic health information. As these developments and potentially far-reaching decisions can affect modern healthcare systems and daily clinical work as well as wildlife conservation, its underlying factual basis must be critically examined. This article therefore provides an overview of the evidence underlying the basic {TCM} concepts, such as Qi, meridians, acupuncture, pulse and tongue diagnostics as well as traditional herbal treatments. Moreover, it discusses whether scientific literature on {TCM} reflects the current standard for evidence-based research, as described in good scientific practice and good clinical practice guidelines. Importantly, misinformation regarding the therapeutic efficacy of animal-derived substances has lead and currently leads to problems with wildlife preservation and animal ethics. Nevertheless, the (re-)discovery of artemisinin more than 50 years ago introduced a novel development in {TCM}: the commingling of Eastern and Western medicine, the appreciation of both systems. The need for more rigorous approaches, fulfilment of and agreement to current guidelines to achieve high-quality research are of utmost relevance. Thereby, ancient knowledge of herbal species and concoctions may serve as a possible treasure box rather than Pandora’s box.},

We have compared abdomen, back and cheek, three anatomical sites representing the distinct embryonic tissues from which the dermis can arise, during homeostasis and wound repair using {RNA} sequencing, histology and fibroblast cultures. Our transcriptional analyses demonstrate differences between body sites that reflect their diverse origins. Moreover, we report histological and transcriptional variations during a wound response, including site differences in {ECM} composition, cell migration and proliferation, and re‐enactment of distinct developmental programmes.

A classification system was established on the basis of the in vitro and in vivo skin permeation/retention behaviors of 12 model drugs. Drug skin penetration/retention exhibited a significant correlation with physicochemical parameters (log {KO}/W, molecular weight, polar surface area, and polarizability). Four representative model drugs were selected to clarify the molecular mechanisms of drug skin permeation/retention behaviors. The excellent lipid-disrupting effect and enhanced partitioning exhibited by propranolol (high permeation–high retention) and zolmitriptan (high permeation-low retention) via the formation of moderate H-bonds with skin lipids were proven by {ATR}–{FTIR} (Δν{asCH}2 {\textgreater} 2 cm−1), Raman spectra (Δ{LPP}, {SPP} {\textgreater} 0.2 nm), and X-ray scattering (lipid crystallization) and were supported by 13C {NMR} results. The low lipid miscibility of zolmitriptan (ΔHzolmitriptan-lipid = 126.92 J/g) caused the low skin retention of this drug. High polarizabiltiy (α = 38.5 × 10−24 cm3) and low H-bond forming capability ({EH}-bond = 0 kcal/mol) restricted terbinafine (low permeation–high retention) in terms of partitioning ({kD}-{SC} = 0.09). Diclofenac (low permeation–low retention) stabilized skin lipids through the formation of strong H-bonds and exhibited excessive drug–lipid miscibility (ΔHdiclofenac-skin = −128.73 J/g), thus restricting its skin absorption. This classification system reflects the most essential drug skin absorption characteristics and provides a theoretical basis for the design of transdermal/topical formulations.},

	abstract = {Ellagic acid is a common metabolite present in many medicinal plants and vegetables. It is present either in free form or as part of more complex molecules (ellagitannins), which can be metabolized to liberate ellagic acid and several of its metabolites, including urolithins. While ellagic acidʼs antioxidant properties are doubtless responsible for many of its pharmacological activities, other mechanisms have also been implicated in its various effects, including its ability to reduce the lipidemic profile and lipid metabolism, alter pro-inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6), and decrease the activity of nuclear factor-κB while increasing nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 expression. These events play an important role in ellagic acidʼs anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Several of these activities, together with the effect of ellagic acid on insulin, glycogen, phosphatases, aldose reductase, sorbitol accumulation, advanced glycation end-product formation, and resistin secretion, may explain its effects on metabolic syndrome and diabetes. In addition, results from recent research have increased the interest in ellagic acid, both as a potential protective agent of the liver and skin and as a potential anticancer agent, due to the specific mechanisms affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, {DNA} damage, and angiogenesis and its aforementioned anti-inflammatory properties. Taken together, these effects make ellagic acid a highly interesting compound that may contribute to different aspects of health; however, more studies are needed, especially on the compoundʼs pharmacokinetic profile.

To carry their catalytic and structure-related functions, proteins must be correctly folded into their unique native three-dimensional structures. Common oxidative protein damage affects their functionality by impairing their catalytic and interactive specificities. Oxidative damage occurs preferentially to misfolded proteins and fixes the misfolded state. This review provides an overview of the mechanism and consequences of oxidative proteome damage - specifically irreversible protein carbonylation - in relation to ageing, including that of the skin as well as to age-related degeneration and diseases ({ARDD}) and their mitigation. A literature review of published manuscripts, available from {PubMed}, focusing on proteome, proteostasis, proteotoxicity, protein carbonylation, related inflammatory diseases, {ARDD} and the impact of the damaged proteome on ageing. During ageing, proteome damage, especially protein carbonylation, correlates with biological age. Carbonylated proteins form aggregates which can be considered as markers and accelerators of ageing and are common markers of most {ARDD}. Protein carbonylation leads to general ageing of the organism and organs including the skin and potentially to diseases including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, diabetes, psoriasis, and skin cancer. Current research is promising and may open new therapeutic approaches and perspectives by targeting proteome protection as an age and {ARDD} management strategy.},

	abstract = {The advantages of hot-melt extrusion technology ({HME}) over conventional
techniques to develop topical semisolids have been established. However, this
technique is not widely used for semisolid production. Therefore, the aim of
this novel work was to develop creams using the melt extrusion technology while
applying Quality by Design ({QbD}) principles to study the effects of the
extrusion process parameters on the product characteristics. The model drug
selected was hydrocortisone acetate. A 23 factorial design was
considered for the factor influence study, which resulted in eight formulations
to be extruded. Of the process parameters considered, the temperature of zone 2
had a significant influence on the work of adhesion of the creams. A similar
permeation profile was obtained for all the formulations with the formulations
following a diffusion based drug release mechanism. The results from the size
distribution graph indicated stable cream formulations. In conclusion, this
technology coupled with a design of experiments approach could be utilized to
study how the extrusion process parameters could be modified to develop
consistent topical creams with ideal product characteristics.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The skin exposome refers to the constellation of external exposures that contribute to cutaneous aging, including solar radiation, air pollution, tobacco smoke, unbalanced nutrition, and cosmetic products. This review explores the skin exposome and the role of a combination hyaluronic acid and mineralized thermal water product used to restore and maintain optimal skin barrier function.
{METHOD}: An expert panel of 7 dermatologists who treat clinical signs of facial aging convened for a one-day meeting to discuss the results of a literature review on the skin exposome and the role of M89, a mineralized thermal water and hyaluronic acid-based gel, to improve the quality of facial skin. Evidence coupled with expert opinion and experience of the panel was used to address clinical challenges in the treatment of photo-aging, and the use of M89.
{RESULTS}: Solar radiation (ultraviolet radiation, visible light, and infrared radiation), air pollution, tobacco smoke, nutrition, and miscellaneous factors, including stress, sleep deprivation, and temperature, may potentiate skin aging by triggering molecular processes that damage skin structure. M89 was developed to maintain and restore skin and contains ingredients to aid physical, hydric, antioxidant, and antimicrobial skin barrier function.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Increasing knowledge of the exposome and microenvironment contributing to skin aging may support a better understanding of measures to support the skin. The initial results of in vitro and clinical studies of M89 show its potential to improve skin barrier function.},

              Matricaria chamomilla
              (Asteraceae) in the twentieth century and has since been identified in other aromatic plants such as
              Eremanthus erythropappus

              α
              ‐bisabolol or bisabolol‐rich oil as an anti‐inflammatory agent is ubiquitous. This compound also exhibits several other pharmacological properties such as analgesic, antibiotic and anticancer activities. Mutagenicity and genotoxicity of bisabolol have also been investigated. Due to the low toxicity associated with bisabolol the Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) has granted this constituent with Generally Regarded as Safe ({GRAS}) status which has promoted its use as an active ingredient in several commercial products. This review aims to summarise the role of
              α

	abstract = {Catechin exhibits numerous physiological characteristics. In this study, we determined the photosensitivity of catechin to various lights under alkaline conditions, and the mechanisms by which catechin generates free radical species and polymerizes via a photoreaction. In addition to this, the application of catechin photolysis was investigated. A solution of catechin is transparent, but turns yellowish under blue light illumination ({BLI}) in neutral or weak alkaline solutions. When catechin is subjected to {BLI}, a dimeric catechin (proanthocyanidin) and a superoxide anion radical (O2•−) are generated in a photolytic reaction. When ascorbic acid or gallic acid is added to catechin and the mixture is subjected to {BLI} at alkaline {pH}, fewer catechin dimers and less O2•− are produced, because both acids inhibit the photosensitive oxidation of catechin. When {AlCl}3 is added to catechin and the mixture is subjected to {BLI} at {pH} 8, a photolytic reaction is suppressed by {AlCl}3, and {AlCl}3 acts as a catalyst for the disconnection of proanthocyanidin during photolysis. Under alkaline conditions, catechin generates O2•− via photosensitive oxidation, which suppresses the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) by at least 4 logs, and deactivates its multi-drug-resistant strain. This study shows that catechin photolysis is a process of oxidation, and that it can be safely applied as a tool for environmental applications.},

The essential oil from dried floral part (capitulata) of the plant has unique chemical profile with a lot of commercial value. In this study, fresh Matricaria chamomilla flowers were used for the extraction of essential oils using Clevenger apparatus and chemical composition was investigated through {GC}/{FID} and {GC}/{MS} analysis. Antimicrobial activity was carried out using disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory ({MIC}) concentration assay; {DPPH} and {ABTS} radical scavenging assays were used for anti-oxidant activity determination, trypsin inhibitory assay for the anti-inflammatory test, standard tyrosinase, alpha-amylase inhibitory assays were also used for other biological activities. For genotoxicity analysis, standard Allium cepa assay was used. Chamomile essential oil ({CEO}) analysis showed the presence of 8 compounds of which six were major compounds namely α-bisabolol oxide, bisabolol oxide {II}, α-bisabolonoxide, γ-himachalene, cis-β-farnesene and chamazulene with a significant area percentage of 48.94\%, 13.48 \%, 12.44\%, 8.58\%, 5.7\% and 3.61\% respectively. This unique chemical profile which is related to the climatic conditions of North East India impacts other biological activities also. The antimicrobial activity showed the essential oil of M. chamomilla ({CEO}) was effective against S. griseus ({ATCC}-10137), fungi A. flavus ({ATCC}-9643) and F. keratoplasticum ({ATCC}-36031) following inhibition zones of 16 mm, 20 mm and 19 mm respectively. The antioxidant assay showed that the {DPPH} assay revealed an {IC}50 value of 21.95 μL/{mL}, and the {ABTS} assay revealed an {IC}50 value of 23.56 μL/{mL}. The {CEO} also possessed antidiabetic activity at 29.88 μL/{mL}, and acetylcholinesterase showed an {IC}50 value of 19.20 μL/{mL}. The {CEO} showed a mitotic index value of 34.20\% where the aberration rate for the {CEO} was 8.60\%.

	abstract = {The cosmetics industry is increasingly concerned with the environmental, social and economic impacts of the manufacture and use of its products. Sustainability in cosmetics is first addressed in the design phase, which influences all the subsequent phases. During selection and sourcing of raw materials, sustainability can be increased by substituting conventional ingredients by sustainable alternatives, use of fair-trade ingredients, synthesis of ingredients using green chemistry, upcycling of agro-food industry byproducts into added value ingredients, and development of waterless products to decrease water footprint. Sustainability during manufacture involves implementing innovative factories which reuse water and energy, for example. Furthermore, companies are also educating the consumer on how to sustainably use cosmetics. In the post-consumer phase, recycling, reusing or refilling the used packaging is preferred to landfill disposal. Finally, companies must also address the carbon footprint arising from the several distribution phases. Here, we review the main strategies used by cosmetic companies to increase sustainability throughout the life cycle of their products. Real-life examples are presented, from multinational companies addressing sustainability at all levels, to smaller brands focusing in a single life cycle phase. We mainly focus on the environmental domain of sustainability, although social and economic problems are also tackled.},

Dermal white adipose tissue ({dWAT}) has recently been recognized as an important organ for both non-metabolic and metabolic health in skin regeneration and rejuvenation. Defective differentiation, adipogenesis, improper adipocytokine production, and immunological dissonance dysfunction in {dWAT} lead to age-associated clinical changes. Here, we review age-related alterations in {dWAT} across levels, emphasizing the mechanisms underlying the regulation of aging. We also discuss the pathogenic changes involved in age-related fat dysfunction and the unfavorable consequences of accelerated skin aging, such as chronic inflammaging, immunosenescence, delayed wound healing, and fibrosis. Research has shown that adipose aging is an early initiation event and a potential target for extending longevity. We believe that adipose tissues play an essential role in aging and form a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of age-related skin diseases. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of this phenomenon.},

Furthermore, aloe administration significantly reduced the {NO} level and exhibited protective effects against sepsis-related death in {LPS}-induced septic mice. These results suggest that aloe metabolites exerted anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, and that these effects were associated with the inhibition of inflammatory mediators.

	abstract = {Chestnut shells in large amounts are significantly underutilized agricultural and forestry waste that can be exploited as a resource for the production of high-valued nature active compounds. In this study, an efficient and green approach was established to extract and recover the highly valued phenolic compound, ellagic acid, from waste chestnut shells with choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents ({DESs}). By utilizing optimized ultrasonic-assisted extraction conditions with choline chloride/n-propanol {DES}, solid–liquid ratio of 40 mg/{mL}, extraction time of 70 min and extraction power of 200 W, highly efficient extraction value for ellagic acid of 4.64 mg/g was obtained. Meanwhile, ellagic acid was recovered easily with a recovery percentage of 94.9\% by anti-solvent precipitation method through the denaturation of {DES} with water. The purity of ellagic acid in the extracts reached 85.6\%, which is more than two times to that via ethanol extraction methods (36.4\%). In addition, the recovered ellagic acid exhibited strong antioxidant activity with {IC}50 (0.309 mg/{mL}) and significant antibacterial activity with Minimal inhibitory concentration ({MIC}) (250 mm) and diameter of inhibition zone ({DIZ}) (17.60 μg/{mL}). The anti-solvent precipitation method could denature {DES}, led to higher extraction and recovery efficiency and high-purity ellagic acid simultaneously in one step. The novel method is of great significance to the whole chestnut production process for the utilization of waste chestnut shells. Furthermore, this method can also be used as a green, pollution-free alternative method for the extraction and recovery of phenolic components from natural resources for pharmaceutical and biochemical applications.},

However, the literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of their stability and how their composition and properties change over time under various conditions. Through this paper, we aim to enhance the existing literature by providing deeper insights into the stability of essential oils and the sustainability of chemical composition in a time-based approach under various conditions. Therefore, four essential oils of the Lamiaceae family (Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris, Mentha spicata, and M. x piperita) were evaluated with respect to their chemical variation influenced by several factors, such as thermal and storage conditions. Three types of containers were utilized to store the essential oils, i.e., glass ampoules, glass tubes, and metallic containers with plastic caps, for up to six months in −20 °C, 4 °C, 23 °C (with or without light exposure), 35 °C, and 45 °C. Samples were routinely analyzed by {GC}-{MS} and components were subjected to principal component analysis to ascertain whether the identified constituents may be useful in reflecting the stability of the analyzed samples. The main compounds appeared to be more stable, while the degradation of minor constituents ({\textless}1.0\%) occurred in all four essential oils despite the storage conditions. Overall, apart from a slight variation in the chemical load, essential oils can be considered stable for various applications, especially those stored under low oxygen availability conditions.},

Ellagic acids/ellagitannins, being characterized by their antioxidant and antiproliferation properties, constitute the majority of polyphenolics in the pomace and are valuable for recovery. In the present study, we developed a novel procedure with sodium bicarbonate assisted extraction ({SBAE}) to recover ellagic acid from raspberry wine pomace. Key parameters in the procedure, i.e., sodium bicarbonate concentration, temperature, time and solid/liquid (S/L) ratio, were investigated by single factor analysis and optimized subsequently by Response Surface Methodology ({RSM}). Optimal parameters for the {SBAE} method here were found to be 1.2\% (w/v) {NaHCO}3, 1:93 (w/v) S/L ratio, 22 min and 100 °C. Under these conditions, the ellagic acid yield was 6.30 ± 0.92 mg/g pomace with an antioxidant activity of 79.0 ± 0.96 μmol Trolox eq/g pomace ({DPPH} assay), which are 2.37 and 1.32 times the values obtained by extraction with methanol–acetone–water solvent, respectively. The considerable improvement in ellagic acid extraction efficiency could be highly attributed to the reactions of lipid saponification and ellagitannin hydrolysis resulted from sodium bicarbonates. The present study has established an organic solvent-free method for the extraction of ellagic acid from raspberry wine pomace, which is feasible and practical in nutraceutical applications.},

Continuous unsustainable harvesting of the Candeia tree has prompted the urgent need to identify alternative crops as a source of this commercially important sesquiterpene alcohol. A chemotaxonomic assessment of two Salvia species indigenous to South Africa is presented and recommended as a potential source of α-bisabolol. The essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of the aerial parts was analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ({GC}–{MS}) and mid-infrared spectroscopy ({MIRS}). Orthogonal projections to latent structures–discriminant analysis ({OPLS}–{DA}) were used for multivariate classification of the oils based on {GC}–{MS} and {MIRS} data. Partial least squares ({PLS}) calibration models were developed on the {MIRS} data for the quantification of α-bisabolol using {GC}–{MS} as the reference method. A clear distinction between Salvia stenophylla and Salvia runcinata oils was observed using {OPLS}–{DA} on both {GC}–{MS} and {MIRS} data.

{METHODS}: Thirty-two healthy female Sprague-Dawley rats were evaluated in four groups: group 1 - intrauterine day 19, group 2 - postpartum day 21, group 3 - postpartum day 60, and group 4 - postpartum month 19. Skin samples from the back, abdomen, head, and upper and lower limbs were obtained from each subject under anesthesia. Tissue specimens were evaluated statistically and morphologically for the thicknesses of the epidermis, dermis, and basement membrane; the number, height, and width of dermal papillae; and the mast cell and pilosebaceous counts per group. The changes in collagen/elastic fibers and glycosaminoglycans were also assessed.
{RESULTS}: Epidermal thickness was the highest in the intrauterine group; it decreased in the postpartum period and increased again in the aged group. Basal membrane thickness increased steadily with age. The number, height, and width of dermal papillae and dermal thickness increased up to day 60 after birth although these decreased in the aged group. Mast cell count also reached the maximum in the intrauterine group and gradually decreased with age. Pilosebaceous units of the dermis were fewer in intrauterine specimens; they showed an increase during the postpartum period and a decrease in the aged group.
{CONCLUSION}: Skin specimens obtained from rats showed striking differences between the intrauterine and postpartum groups. Moreover, the postpartum group showed considerable intra-group differences.},

The thermal oxidation of {PUFAs} is a free radical chain reaction, in which hydroperoxides are generally recognized as the primary major products. Hydroperoxides of {PUFAs} are easily decomposed into a very complex mixture of secondary products with the decrease in unsaturation. The oxidative advance of {PUFAs} during heating was studied by the determination of unsaturation percentage at different temperatures and heating times. Oils frequently used in food frying such as olive oil, sunflower oil, corn oil and seeds oil (sunflower, safflower and canola seed) were studied. The results show there is a decrease in unsaturation starting at 150°C and becoming more pronounced at temperatures around 250°C. The following variations were found in the unsaturation percentage, expressed as methyl linoleate, between the original sample and the sample heated at 300°C for 40 min: olive oil (19–6\%), sunflower oil (29–12\%), corn oil (28–18\%) and seeds oil (23–11\%). This variation in unsaturation grade provides evidence of the transformation of essential {PUFAs} and subsequent decrease in the oils’ nutritional value. The internal standard method is suitably precise when the n-valeronitrile is used as standard as shown by the 1–2\% relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) found for seven replicates.},

In plants, anthocyanins play a role not only in reproduction, by attracting pollinators and seed dispersers, but also in protection against various abiotic and biotic stresses. There is accumulating evidence that anthocyanins have health-promoting properties, which makes anthocyanin metabolism an interesting target for breeders and researchers. In this review, the state of the art knowledge concerning anthocyanins in the Solanaceous vegetables, i.e., pepper, tomato, eggplant, and potato, is discussed, including biochemistry and biological function of anthocyanins, as well as their genetic and environmental regulation. Anthocyanin accumulation is determined by the balance between biosynthesis and degradation. Although the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway has been well-studied in Solanaceous vegetables, more research is needed on the inhibition of biosynthesis and, in particular, the anthocyanin degradation mechanisms if we want to control anthocyanin content of Solanaceous vegetables. In addition, anthocyanin metabolism is distinctly affected by environmental conditions, but the molecular regulation of these effects is poorly understood. Existing knowledge is summarized and current gaps in our understanding are highlighted and discussed, to create opportunities for the development of anthocyanin-rich crops through breeding and environmental management.},

In addition, recent research has reported that anthocyanins have important antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, which can be used in the chemoprevention of various diseases such as diabetes, obesity and even cancer. However, anthocyanins have a major disadvantage, namely their low stability. Thus, their stability is influenced by a number of factors such as {pH}, light, temperature, co-pigmentation, sulfites, ascorbic acid, oxygen and enzymes. As such, this review aims at summarizing the effects of these factors on the stability of anthocyanins and their degradation. From this point of view, it is very important to be precisely aware of the impact that each parameter has on the stability of anthocyanins, in order to minimize their negative action and subsequently potentiate their beneficial health effects.},

	abstract = {Centella asiatica has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, its anti-dermatitic effect has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the anti-dermatitic effects of titrated extract of Centella asiatica ({TECA}) in a phthalic anhydride ({PA})-induced atopic dermatitis ({AD}) animal model as well as in vitro model. An {AD}-like lesion was induced by the topical application of five percent {PA} to the dorsal skin or ear of Hos:{HR}-1 mouse. After {AD} induction, 100 μL of 0.2\% and 0.4\% of {TECA} (40 μg or 80 μg/cm2) was spread on the dorsum of the ear or back skin three times a week for four weeks. We evaluated dermatitis severity, histopathological changes and changes in protein expression by Western blotting for inducible nitric oxide synthase ({iNOS}), cyclooxygenase-2 ({COX}-2), and {NF}-κB activity, which were determined by electromobility shift assay ({EMSA}). We also measured {TNF}-α, {IL}-1β, {IL}-6, and {IgE} concentration in the blood of {AD} mice by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ({ELISA}). {TECA} treatment attenuated the development of {PA}-induced atopic dermatitis. Histological analysis showed that {TECA} inhibited hyperkeratosis, mast cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells. {TECA} treatment inhibited expression of {iNOS} and {COX}-2, and {NF}-κB activity as well as the release of {TNF}-α, {IL}-1β, {IL}-6, and {IgE}. In addition, {TECA} (1, 2, 5 μg/{mL}) potently inhibited Lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}) (1 μg/{mL})-induced {NO} production, expression of {iNOS} and {COX}-2, and {NF}-κB {DNA} binding activities in {RAW}264.7 macrophage cells. Our data demonstrated that {TECA} could be a promising agent for {AD} by inhibition of {NF}-κB signaling.},

	abstract = {Atopic dermatitis ({AD}) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by an impaired skin barrier and intense itchiness, which decreases the individual’s quality of life. No fully effective therapeutic agents have prevailed for {AD} due to an insufficient grasp of the complex etiology. Ellagic acid ({EA}), a natural compound, has anti-inflammatory properties in chronic diseases. The effects of {EA} on {AD} have not yet been explored. The present study investigated the effects of {EA} on {TNF}-α/{IFN}-γ-stimulated {HaCaT} keratinocytes and house dust mite-induced {AD}-like skin lesions in {NC}/Nga mice. Treatment with {EA} suppressed inflammatory responses in keratinocytes by regulating critical inflammatory signaling pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases and signal transducers and activators of transcription. In vivo studies using a {DfE}-induced {AD} mouse model showed the effects of {EA} administration through ameliorated skin lesions via decremented histological inflammatory reactions. These results suggest that {EA} could be a potential therapeutic alternative for the treatment of {AD} by inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways.},

In this study, 16 natural essential oils and 14 single fragrance ingredients were investigated for their potential as antimicrobial agents. Methods: Paper disk diffusion assays were performed to assess the antimicrobial activities of the essential oils and single fragrance ingredients against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcusepidermidis, Escherichiacoli, Pseudomonasaeruginosa, Bacillussubtilis,Candidaalbicans,Aspergillusniger, {andMalasseziafurfur}. Results: Cinnamon bark and neroli essential oils, which contain linalool, exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against S. aureus and C. albicans. The single fragrance ingredients citral, D-limonene, and hydroxycitronellal exhibited antibacterial effects against S.aureus and C.albicans. Cinnamon bark oil also showed good antifungal effects against A.niger and M.furfur. Clove essential oil, which contains eugenol as the main ingredient, showed antifungal effects against M.furfur, and aurantiol also exhibited antibacterial effects {againstM}.furfur.S.aureus,E.coli, {andP}.aeruginosa, which are regulated in distributed cosmetics, were susceptible to the effects of cinnamon bark oil and phenylethyl alcohol. Bergamot and lavender oils exerted good antibacterial effects against S. aureus, but not S. epidermidis. In addition, rosemary oil, rose absolute, and phenylethyl alcohol, which showed good antifungal effects against C.albicans, had no or little antibacterial effect on S.epidermidis. Conclusion: Our results suggest that essential oils can be used as alternative preservatives and antimicrobial agents for atopic dermatitis and dandruff.},

However, its α-glucosidase activity in vitro assay not yet reported. Our goal in this study is to isolate and identify active compounds as α-glucosidase inhibitor and antioxidant from aqueous ethanol 70\% (v/v) extract of C. asiatica. The extract was partitioned by n-hexane, {EtOAc}, and n-butanol sequentially. Among the fractions tested, {EtOAc} fraction was showed the highest antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities with an {IC}50 values of 45.42 and 73.17μg/{mL}, respectively. The antioxidant activity was conducted by determination of {DPPH} radical scavenging activity, whereas α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was determined against yeast α-glucosidase. Furthermore, isolation of the ethyl acetate extract yielded two active compounds, which were identified as kaempferol (1) and quercetin (2). Both of the compounds showed good yeast α-glucosidase inhibitory activity with {IC}50 values of 16.50 and 21.61μg/{mL}, respectively. In addition those compounds also could scavenge {DPPH} radical activity with {IC}50 values of 9.64 and 11.97μg/{mL}, respectively. Due to its ability in reducing α-glucosidase activity and scavenging free radical activity, the C. asiatica appears to be a potential as a good resource for future development of antioxidant and antidiabetic drug.},

The trend for “clean” skincare products and search for anti-aging retinoid alternatives have poised {BAK} as a “must-have” ingredient in skincare. Aims Our aim was to review the data for the applications of {BAK} in dermatology. Methods This is a systematic review of {PubMed}. Results Thirty articles matched our search terms [“Bakuchiol” and “Dermatology”] or [“Bakuchiol” and “Skin”] of which one did not meet inclusion criteria, 16 were pre-clinical studies, seven clinical studies, three commentaries, two narrative reviews, and one report on adverse events. {BAK} has been mostly studied for its effects on photoaging, acne, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation ({PIH}), showing beneficial results comparable to those achieved by topical retinoids. While having no structural resemblance to retinoids, {BAK} can function as a retinol analog, through retinol-like regulation of gene expression. In in vivo studies, {BAK} was used alone or in combination with other products resulting in a significant reduction in photodamage, hyperpigmentation, wrinkle scores, and acne severity. Additionally, in vitro studies hinted at its anti-cancer properties by inhibiting epidermal growth factor induced neoplastic cell transformation. Also, demonstrated potential applications in psoriasis by normalizing keratinocyte activity and in pigmentary disorders through inhibition of melanogenesis. There was one adverse event case reported of contact dermatitis in the literature. Conclusions Bakuchiol is a retinol alternative with anti-aging, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Additional studies are warranted to better understand its applications in dermatology.},

In addition, microemulsions can enhance skin permeation of the loaded substances. They are classified into three types: oil-in-water, bicontinuous, and water-in-oil. All types of microemulsions can be formed spontaneously when the ratios of oil, water, and amphiphile in the systems are appropriate. These proper ratios can be found in a microemulsion region of a phase diagram. The efficiency of microemulsions in topical application is related to microemulsion type. Microemulsion characterization needs a combination of the data from several experimental techniques. Numerous applications of cosmetic microemulsions include skin-care, hair-care, and personal-care products for improving the product efficiency and stability. Moreover, new materials have been developed to be used in cosmetic microemulsion formulations for increasing the product efficiency and reducing the toxicity.

Asiaticoside, sourced from Centella asiatica, possesses properties that address {DFUs}’ healing challenges: insufficient angiogenesis, persistent inflammation, and delayed tissue regeneration. By incorporating asiaticoside into bioscaffold 3D designs including hydrogels, microneedle arrays, and nanofibrous meshes, therapeutic efficacy is optimized. This review examines the mechanisms of asiaticoside in wound healing (collagen production, angiogenesis modulation, inflammation reduction, and cell migration and proliferation) based on in vitro and in vivo studies. Asiaticoside also demonstrates synergistic abilities with other biomaterials, creating the possibility of more effective therapies. While preclinical research is promising, clinical trials are crucial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of asiaticoside-loaded bioscaffolds in patients with {DFUs}. Asiaticoside-loaded bioscaffolds are a significant development in wound healing and may aid in treating hyperglycemic wound complications. Their ability to offer individualized treatment plans has the potential to enhance the quality of life of those who suffer from diabetes.

	shorttitle = {Back to the roots},
	abstract = {Background
De Materia Medica written by Pedanios Dioscorides (1 century {CE}) has shaped European and Mediterranean herbal medicine to a large extent. Despite its fundamental importance for modern medico-botanical traditions the content of this work has never been systematically assessed.
Purpose
We present a quantitative survey of the botanical drugs described in De Materia Medica (ex Matthioli, 1568) and identify overall therapeutic, diachronic and botanical patterns. The extracted data may serve as a baseline and help to better contextualize research on herbal drugs and phytotherapy.
Methods
Therapeutic uses of herbal drugs were extracted through line-by-line reading of a digitized version of the treatise. For each plant usage mentioned in the text we recorded (I) the chapter number, ({II}) the putative botanical identity, ({III}) the plant part, ({IV}) the symptoms or disease, (V) the mode of administration, ({VI}) our biomedical interpretation of the ancient ailment or disease description as well as ({VII}) the organ- and symptom-defined category under which the use was filed.
Sections
An introduction to Dioscorides’ De Materia Medica and Matthioli's Renaissance commentary is followed by a description of the employed methodology. The results and discussion section introduces the generated database comprising 5314 unique therapeutic uses of 536 plant taxa and 924 herbal drugs. Separate subsections address salient patterns such as the frequent recommendation of Fabaceae seeds for dermatology, Apiaceae seeds as antidotes and Apiaceae exudates for neurology and psychosomatic disorders as well as the heavy reliance on subterranean parts as drugs.
Conclusions
The therapeutic knowledge described in De Materia Medica (ex Matthioli, 1568) offers unique insights into classical Mediterranean epidemiology and herbal medicine. Drugs that lost importance over time as well as remedies used for diseases now controlled by preventive medicine and industrially produced drugs may be interesting starting points for research on herbal medicine and drug discovery. Apart from promoting future data mining, the study may also help to prove the tradition of use, which is required for the regulatory approval of certain herbal products.},

	abstract = {Skin and soft tissue infections are quite common in elderly people. A number of special conditions and circumstances need to be considered in the diagnosis and therapy. It is important to try to establish the causative organism, exclude other cutaneous disorders and identify precipitating factors. Treatment modalities include antiseptics, topical and systemic antibacterials, dressings and biotherapy. Skin infections presenting with erythema, blisters, pustules, and ulcerations or in body folds are described in detail. Cellulitis and infected ulcers are the most commonly encountered cutaneous infections in the elderly. Accurate and quick diagnosis and treatment are imperative to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. Appropriate antibacterials, antiseptics and dressings are necessary depending on the severity of the clinical presentation and resistance patterns. Laboratory tests, such as skin swabs, to establish the exact pathogen take time and the results might represent colonisation rather than infection of the skin. Cellulitis should be clinically distinguished from erysipelas and necrotising fasciitis. The latter is a life-threatening condition, which in the majority of cases requires surgical debridement of the infected tissue. Blisters and honey-coloured crusts are typical features of impetigo. It is very contagious and close contacts should be examined. Folliculitis is a commonly seen skin infection, which often responds to the use of antiseptics and topical antibacterials. More severe pustular skin eruptions, such as furunculosis and carbunculosis, usually require treatment with systemic antibacterials. Intertrigo and erythrasma have a predilection for the body folds, especially the axillae and groin, and topical therapy is usually sufficient. Secondary skin infections are often the result of persistent pruritus associated with increasing dryness of the aging skin. Emollients and antihistamines are useful measures. Primary cutaneous disorders and systemic diseases should be excluded with the aid of appropriate investigations, such as blood tests and skin biopsy. Staphylococcus aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci are the most common causative organisms of cutaneous infections.},

              Objective
              The study was undertaken to compare the skin care related activities of retinol and bakuchiol, a potential alternative to retinoids. Retinol is a pivotal regulator of differentiation and growth of developing as well as adult skin. Retinoic acid is the major physiologically active metabolite of retinol regulating gene expression through retinoic acid receptor – dependant and independent pathways.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Comparative gene expression profiling of both substances in the {EpiDerm}
                {FT}
                full thickness skin substitute model was undertaken. Furthermore, type I, {III} and {IV} collagen, as well as aquaporin 3 expression was analyzed by {ELISA} and/or histochemistry in human dermal fibroblasts and/or Epiderm {FT} skin substitutes.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Bakuchiol is a meroterpene phenol abundant in seeds and leaves of the plant
                Psoralea corylifolia
                . We present evidence that bakuchiol, having no structural resemblance to retinoids, can function as a functional analogue of retinol. Volcano plots showed great overall similarity of retinol and bakuchiol effects on the gene expression profile. This similarity was confirmed by the side‐by‐side comparison of the modulation of individual genes, as well as on the protein level by {ELISA} and histochemistry. Retinol‐like functionality was further confirmed for the upregulation of types I and
                {IV}
                collagen in
                {DNA}
                microarray study and also show stimulation of type
                {III}
                collagen in the mature fibroblast model. Bakuchiol was also formulated into a finished skin care product and was tested in clinical case study by twice‐a‐day facial application. The results showed that, after 12 weeks treatment, significant improvement in lines and wrinkles, pigmentation, elasticity, firmness and overall reduction in photo‐damage was observed, without usual retinol therapy‐associated undesirable effects.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Based on these data, we propose that bakuchiol can function as an anti‐ageing compound through retinol‐like regulation of gene expression.

            Résumé
            
              Objectif
              L'étude a été menée pour comparer les activités liées aux soins de la peau du rétinol et du bakuchiol, une alternative potentielle aux rétinoïdes. Le rétinol est un régulateur essentiel de la différenciation et de la croissance de la peau en développement ainsi que la peau des adultes. L'acide rétinoïque est le principal métabolite physiologiquement actif du rétinol qui régule l'expression des gènes par des voies dépendantes et indépendantes du récepteur de l'acide rétinoïque.
            
            
              Méthodes
              
                Un profilage comparatif d'expression génétique de ces deux substances dans le modèle substitut de la peau {EpiDerm}
                {FT}
                a été entrepris. La synthèse des collagènes de type I,
                {III}
                et
                {IV}
                et de l'aquaporine 3 dans des fibroblastes dermiques humains normaux ont été analysés par
                {ELISA}
                et/ou en histochimie dans le modèle de peau {EpiDerm}
                {TM} {FT}
                .
              
            
            
              Résultats
              
                Bakuchiol est un phénol meroterpène abondant dans les graines et les feuilles de la
                Psoralea corylifolia
                . Nous présentons des preuves que bakuchiol, n'ayant aucune ressemblance structurelle avec les rétinoïdes, peut fonctionner comme un analogue fonctionnel de rétinol. Les diagrammes de type Volcano montrent la grande similitude de l'effet du rétinol et du bakuchiol sur l'expression des gènes. Cette ressemblance a été aussi démontrée par la comparaison de la modulation de l'expression de gènes particulaires, appartenant a de différentes groupes fonctionnelles. La fonctionnalité rétinol ‐like a été confirmée par la régulation à la hausse du collagène de type I et
                {IV}
                et aquaporine 3 au niveau de proteines par {ELISA} et histochimie. Le bakuchiol a également été formulé dans un produit de soin de la peau et a été testé dans une étude clinique avec deux applications par jour au visage. Les résultats ont montré que, après le traitement de douze semaines, une amélioration significative a été observée dans les rides et ridules, la pigmentation, l'élasticité, la fermeté et la réduction globale des dommages du photo‐vieillissement, sans les effets indésirables habituels associés à la thérapie au rétinol.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Sur la base de ces données, nous proposons que le bakuchiol peut fonctionner comme un composé anti‐ vieillissement grâce à la réglementation de l'expression des gènes similaire au rétinol.},

Here, we investigated the potential protective role of barbaloin in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced acute lung injury ({ALI}) and clarified the underlying mechanism in vitro. Histological analysis showed that barbaloin exhibited a certain protective effect on {LPS}-induced {ALI}. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the actions of barbaloin, {LPS}-stimulated macrophages were used in this study. The results showed that barbaloin decreased the phosphorylation levels of {IκBα} and {NF}-κB p65, leading to a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines ({TNF}-α, {IL}-1β and {IL}-6). Furthermore, barbaloin also reduced the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) similarly to the antioxidant N‑acetyl‑l‑cysteine ({NAC}), which alone repressed the {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase ({PI}3K) and {AKT}. Additionally, a pharmacological inhibitor of {PI}3K/{AKT}, {LY}294002, also restrained the phosphorylation levels of {IκBα} and {NF}-κB p65 and thereby decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, these results show that barbaloin possesses a protective effect on {LPS}-induced {ALI} via suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines through the {ROS}-mediated {PI}3K/{AKT}/{NF}-κB pathway.},

	abstract = {Pomegranates are an excellent source of ellagic acid ({EA}), ellagitannins ({ETs}), anthocyanins and other phytochemicals. The health benefits of pomegranate (Pom) have been mainly related to its {EA} and {ET} content. The objective of the present study was to determine {EA} bioavailability and bioactivity from different sources such as pure/free or natural form ({PomJ}). This was a cross-over study with healthy volunteers consuming one dose of {EA} dietary supplement (500 mg free {EA}) vs. one serving of {PomJ} (237 {mL}, ∼120 mg of {EA}) in a random order. Our data showed that there was no difference in plasma {EA} concentration between {PomJ} and {EA} intake; however, urinary dimethylellagic acid glucuronide ({DMEAG}), normalized to creatinine, was significantly higher after the consumption of {PomJ} compared to {EA}. Plasma insulin at 1 h increased after {PomJ} consumption compared to the baseline while decreased after {EA} consumption compared to the baseline. Plasma glucose decreased below the baseline 2 h after the consumption of {PomJ} but not {EA}. Plasma leptin was significantly decreased at 1 and 2 h after {PomJ} and {EA} consumption. Plasma {MCP}1 decreased only after {PomJ} but not after pure {EA} consumption. To conclude, one serving of {PomJ} provided the same level of {EA} in blood, while the increase in phase {II} metabolism of {EA} and an acute suppression of plasma {MCP}1 were only observed after {PomJ} consumption, suggesting that other constituents present in {PomJ}, in addition to {EA}, are bioactive and likely play a role in regulating {EA} phase {II} metabolism.},

We developed a safe method of administering hyaluronan into the human {SC} and determined its penetration route. The amount of hyaluronan that penetrated into the {SC} was 1.5–3 times higher in the presence of magnesium chloride hexahydrate ({MgCl}2) than other metal chlorides. The root-mean-square radius of hyaluronan in water decreased with the addition of {MgCl}2. Moreover, {MgCl}2 solutions maintained their dissolved state on a plastic plate for a long time, suggesting that size compaction and inhibition of hyaluronan precipitation on the skin enhanced hyaluronan into the {SC}. Our results also strongly suggest that an intercellular route contributes to the penetration of hyaluronan from the upper to the middle layer of the {SC}. No disruption to the {SC} barrier was observed after continuous use once a day for 1 month, demonstrating the potential of our method for the safe, topical application of hyaluronan.},

	abstract = {The essential oil of German chamomile (Matricaria recutita L.) is widely used in food, cosmetics, and the pharmaceutical industry. α-Bisabolol is the main active substance in German chamomile. Farnesyl diphosphate synthase ({FPS}) and α-bisabolol synthase ({BBS}) are key enzymes related to the α-bisabolol biosynthesis pathway. However, little is known about the α-bisabolol biosynthesis pathway in German chamomile, especially the transcription factors ({TFs}) related to the regulation of α-bisabolol synthesis. In this study, we identified {MrFPS} and {MrBBS} and investigated their functions by prokaryotic expression and expression in hairy root cells of German chamomile. The results suggest that {MrFPS} is the key enzyme in the production of sesquiterpenoids, and {MrBBS} catalyzes the reaction that produces α-bisabolol. Subcellular localization analysis showed that both {MrFPS} and {MrBBS} proteins were located in the cytosol. The expression levels of both {MrFPS} and {MrBBS} were highest in the extension period of ray florets. Furthermore, we cloned and analyzed the promoters of {MrFPS} and {MrBBS}. A large number of cis-acting elements related to light responsiveness, hormone response elements, and cis-regulatory elements that serve as putative binding sites for specific {TFs} in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses were identified. We identified and studied {TFs} related to {MrFPS} and {MrBBS}, including {WRKY}, {AP}2, and {MYB}. Our findings reveal the biosynthesis and regulation of α-bisabolol in German chamomile and provide novel insights for the production of α-bisabolol using synthetic biology methods.},

The activation of these enzymes is tightly controlled by their production as inactive zymogens that gain catalytic activity following signaling events promoting their aggregation into dimers or macromolecular complexes. Activation of apoptotic caspases results in inactivation or activation of substrates, and the generation of a cascade of signaling events permitting the controlled demolition of cellular components. Activation of inflammatory caspases results in the production of active proinflammatory cytokines and the promotion of innate immune responses to various internal and external insults. Dysregulation of caspases underlies human diseases including cancer and inflammatory disorders, and major efforts to design better therapies for these diseases seek to understand how these enzymes work and how they can be controlled., Caspases are key regulators of apoptosis and inflammation. Insufficient caspase activation can promote tumorigenesis or infection; hyperactivation can promote neurodegeneration or inflammatory conditions.},

In particular, the reactions of catechin as a model tannin and methoxy-substituted hydroxybenzhydrols as model lignin functionalities were investigated. Tannins and lignins constitute a significant portion of the humic substances in aquatic systems, which are themselves the main component of dissolved organic matter thought to be responsible for the absorption and attenuation of light in these environments. Catechin (1) was found to undergo a reversible photoisomerization reaction to give epicatechin (2). Such a reaction is an explicit example of a photon absorbing process that enables catechin (1) and its derivatives to act as natural sunscreens by attenuating light energy through non-destructive reactions. The methoxy-substituted hydroxybenzhydrols were found to undergo photosolvolysis reactions via efficient generation of quinone methide intermediates. The intermediate quinone methides were observed to be longer lived, and thus more stable, than previously studied hydroxybenzhydrol derivatives. The meta-hydroxybenzhydrol isomer (5) was found to undergo additional chemistry leading to the production of a ring-closed fluorene from the quinone methide intermediate.},

{MAIN} {METHODS}: We used lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-activated {RAW} 264.7 macrophages as an in vitro model for our studies.
{KEY} {FINDINGS}: Chamomile treatment inhibited the release of {LPS}-induced prostaglandin E(2) in {RAW} 264.7 macrophages. This effect was found to be due to inhibition of {COX}-2 enzyme activity by chamomile. In addition, chamomile caused reduction in {LPS}-induced {COX}-2 {mRNA} and protein expression, without affecting {COX}-1 expression. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, sulindac and a specific {COX}-2 inhibitor, {NS}398, were shown to act similarly in {LPS}-activated {RAW} 264.7 cells. Our data suggest that chamomile works by a mechanism of action similar to that attributed to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

A total of 1879 images photographed with a Leica {DM}3000 optical microscope were morphometrically analyzed using Image {ProPlus} 7.0 for further statistical analysis with {GraphPad} 9.0. Our results showed a reduction in epidermis thickness, interdigitation and mitotic indexes, while melanocyte count was raised. Papillary but not reticular dermis showed increased thickness with aging. Specifically, in the papillary layer mast cells and glycosaminoglycans were expanded, whereas the reticular dermis displayed a diminution in glycosaminoglycans and elastic fibers. Moreover, total cellularity and vascularization of both dermises were diminished with aging. This morphometric analysis of photoprotected areas reveals that intrinsic aging significantly influences human skin composition. This study paves the way for further research into the molecular basis underpinning these alterations, and into potential antiaging strategies.},

	abstract = {Skin is the largest organ in the human body and functions as a protective barrier. Molecules can penetrate the skin by three main routes: (1) intracellular (across the corneocytes), (2) intercellular lipids, and (3) appendages. Drugs are delivered to and through the skin for the treatment of skin diseases and systemic diseases, respectively. For dermatological applications, formulations are targeted to different layers of the skin to protect, enhance the appearance, or deliver medicaments to the skin. There is enormous interest in expanding the number of drugs delivered through the skin due to the perceived advantages of high patient compliance, controlled drug delivery, ease of termination of therapy, flexibility in the choice of drug administration site, and ease of altering the dose by controlling the application area and avoidance of first-pass effect. The recent appearance of nanotechnologies have opened up new opportunities for the development of nanosystems for topical and transdermal applications, and many other applications in the field of nanoscience. Many of those drug delivery systems have been specifically developed for skin applications of a huge amount of drugs, in medical and pharmaceutical applications. The goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive overview of the different types of {DDS}, their main characteristics and mechanisms of action in skin penetration, some applications already in use, and future prospects of nanosystems for dermal and transdermal drug delivery systems.},

Skin penetration enhancement techniques (physical, chemical, mechanical) have been developed to improve bioavailability and increase the range of drugs for which topical and transdermal delivery is a viable option. Moreover, there have been many innovations in drug delivery systems that have a proven record of efficacy as well as safety for cutaneous delivery. These may include liposomes, ethosomes, transferosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, dendrimers, and several different polymer-based nanoparticles. This chapter expounds the skin as a barrier and things to know for transdermal research along with an exhaustive discussion on the factors affecting the design of transdermal drug delivery systems.

This chapter contains information about different flavonoids reported for the management of inflammatory disorders with their possible mechanism. These compounds also regulate the oxidative status and prevent damage caused by oxidative stress such as the antioxidant effect. The high levels of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor ({TNF}), interleukin ({IL})-1, and {IL}-6, are allied with chronic inflammatory diseases. Some flavonoids, namely luteolin, quercetin, and apigenin, reduce cytokine expression and their secretion. It suggests that these flavonoids may have a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of inflammation-associated diseases as cytokine modulators. Flavonoids also have wide pharmacological effects by inhibiting some enzymes such as cyclooxygenase, aldose reductase, xanthenes oxidase, Ca2+ {ATPase}, phosphodiesterase, and lipoxygenase. In conclusion, flavonoids can produce health benefits in a variety of ways.

The conditions of the hair, skin, or nails are very common and almost everyone experiences symptoms of one or other dermatologic condition at some point in their life. Some of the most common dermatologic conditions include acne, wrinkles, cold sores, dermatitis, and others. To treat these conditions, various dermatological formulations are utilized which involve gels, creams, powders, aerosols, and transdermal patches. The transdermal drug delivery systems have several advantages. It can avoid first-pass metabolism and maintain plasma drug concentration for a prolonged time, requiring less dose to be administered. Furthermore, it decreases {GIT} side or unwanted effects, and one can remove the formulation in case of toxic effects and increase patient compliance. On the other hand, the administration of medications via these methods increases the risk of skin irritation at the site of delivery, which is one of the possible adverse effects. Skin irritation reactions include allergic contact dermatitis, which is a delayed, T-cell-mediated inflammatory response to a specific allergen, and irritant contact dermatitis ({ICD}), which is an inflammatory response caused by repeated or direct skin exposure to weak irritants. Both of these types of dermatitis are known as {ICD}. In this chapter, we discussed various dermatological formulations, manufacturing challenges and methods to overcome these challenges.

	abstract = {Abstact
The published literature was summarised and reviewed for historical/archaeological data on the usage and chemical composition of Egyptian eye cosmetics (‘kohls’). A total of 27 kohl samples were purchased in modern-day Egypt: 18 in Cairo, 4 in Aswan and 5 in Luxor. Also, very small amounts of material were carefully removed from inside six Pharaonic kohl pots (held in the Royal Albert Memorial Museum and Art Gallery, Exeter, {UK}). These pots were dated to either Middler or New Kingdom (i.e. between c. 2040 {BC} to c. 1070 {BC}). Each to the 33 samples was analysed by one or more of the following techniques: X-ray powder diffration ({XRPD}), low vacuum scanning electron microscopy ({LV} {SEM}), infrared spectroscopy ({IR}) and the relatively new technique of quantitative scanning electron microscopy ({QEMSCAN}). For the 27 modern-day samples, it was found that the main components for six was galena ({PbS}) and for the remaining samples one of the following: amorphous cabron (6), calcite ({CaCO}3) (6), elemental silicon (1), talc (Mg3Si4O10({OH})2) (2), cuprite (Cu2O) (1), goethite ({FeO}({OH}) (1), barite ({BaSO}4) (1), halite ({NaCl}) (1), and for two samples, an unknown amorphous organic compound. Three of the galena-based samples also had their (average) particle sizes determined from electron micrographs. Five of the six Pharaonic kohl pots contained lead-based conpounds (one being empty of kohl). Two were black and so were most likely galena, whilst the other three were white and so were one or more of several possible “made” or natural lead compounds. The composition of the six Pharaonic kohl pots was also studied (only using the {LV} {SEM} and {QEMSCAN} analystical techniques) and the results compared to the compositions expected from previous visual inspections. Whilst only about a quarter (22\%) of the modern-day Egyptian kohl samples contained a lead compound as a major component; it was seen, both from our results and those reviewed, that in the Pharaonic past this percentage was much higher.},

Additionally, the nature of the solvent dipropylene glycol ({DPPG}) showed a capacity to stabilize F.A. A series of experiments was further planned for studying the mechanism of degradation of F.A. In a prototype of a cosmetic medium, F.A degrades first through a decarboxylation step, leading to 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene ({PVG}).

	abstract = {Ellagic acid ({EA}) has long been recognized as a very active antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial agent. However, its low bioavailability has often hampered its applications in health-related fields. Here, we report a phospholipid vesicle-based controlled release system for {EA}, involving the exploitation of chestnut wood mud ({CWM}), an industrial by-product from chestnut tannin production, as a largely available and low-cost source of this compound. Two kinds of {CWM} with different particle size distributions, indicated as {CWM}-A and {CWM}-B ({\textless}100 and 32 µm, respectively), containing 5 ± 1\% w/w {EA}, were incorporated into transfersomes. The latter were small in size ({\textasciitilde}100 nm), homogeneously dispersed, and negatively charged. 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ({DPPH}) and ferric reducing/antioxidant power ({FRAP}) assays indicated up to three-fold improvement in the antioxidant properties of {CWM} upon incorporation into transfersomes.

	abstract = {The skin exposome is defined as the totality of environmental exposures over the life course that can induce or modify various skin conditions. Here, we review the impact on the skin of solar exposure, air pollution, hormones, nutrition and psychological factors. Photoageing, photocarcinogenesis and pigmentary changes are well-established consequences of chronic exposure of the skin to solar radiation. Exposure to traffic-related air pollution contributes to skin ageing. Particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide cause skin pigmentation/lentigines, while ozone causes wrinkles and has an impact on atopic eczema. Human skin is a major target of hormones, and they exhibit a wide range of biological activities on the skin. Hormones decline with advancing age influencing skin ageing. Nutrition has an impact on numerous biochemical processes, including oxidation, inflammation and glycation, which may result in clinical effects, including modification of the course of skin ageing and photoageing. Stress and lack of sleep are known to contribute to a pro-inflammatory state, which, in turn, affects the integrity of extracellular matrix proteins, in particular collagen. Hormone dysregulation, malnutrition and stress may contribute to inflammatory skin disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne and rosacea.},

This study is aimed is to evaluate the effectiveness of C. nucifera and glycerin for secondary prevention of {OHD} among batik (Indonesian traditional fabric) workers. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, the effect of glycerine-C. nucifera cream versus glycerin-only was considered with multiple afterwork applications of moisturizer over a 2-week period on batik workers with {OHD}. Assessment of trans-epidermal water loss ({TEWL}), skin capacitance, and a clinical assessment using the Hand Eczema Severity Index ({HECSI}) were carried out at day 0 and 14. The results show thirty-two batik dyeing and/or rinsing workers were enrolled in the study with mild to moderate {OHD}. Clinical improvement was demonstrated by 20\% decrease in {HECSI} and {TEWL}, and 20\% increase in skin capacitance. Both moisturizers were equally effective for the secondary prevention of {OHD}. As a conclusion, glycerine-C. nucifera and glycerin-only cream are equally effective for secondary prevention for {OHD} among batik worker to reduce the prevalence of hand dermatitis.},

            The use of emulsifying bases in formulas helps to stabilize the product and improve its rheological and sensory attributes. In this study, the physical and chemical properties of several prepared cosmetic creams were determined. Apparent viscosity and thixotropy were evaluated by viscosimeter, while spreadability was ascertained by extensometer. Moreover, a group of 10 trained members evaluated the sensory properties of the formulas. The obtained formulas based upon natural emulsifiers are characterized by very good physical and chemical properties, high stabilization and good usage quality. The results were confirmed by sensory analysis. The cosmetic creams made with synthetic emulsifying bases were rated the worst by the study participants, which correlated with the physical tests.},

	abstract = {Plant materials play a very significant role as components of products being used both for medicinal and cosmetic purposes. Due to the high content of active substances, they can play an important role as extracts with antioxidant, regenerative, and antiaging properties. The skin aging process depends on various pathological and physiological processes, among which the degradation of extracellular matrix biomolecules such as collagen and elastin, which significantly affect the maintenance of good skin condition, is very important. The secondary metabolites and plant extracts may have collagenase and elastase inhibitory activity. This activity is mainly due to the high content of a wide range of various biologically active compounds, such as polyphenols, which include, among others, flavonoids, phenolic acids, tocopherols, and tannins. The work involved a comprehensive assessment of the plant from Apiaceae family such as Meum athamanticum L., Centella asiatica L., and Aegopodium podagraria L. extract as a multifunctional raw material. During study antioxidant properties, phenolic compounds and flavonoids content, effect on collagenase and elastase enzyme activity (antiaging effect), cytotoxic properties on skin cells (keratinocytes and fibroblasts), and cell migration capacity were analyzed. It has been shown that the highest antioxidant capacity can be observed for the extract of herb of Aegopodium podagraria L. When the concentration reached 5\% all tested extracts had a positive effect on the cell proliferation of both keratinocytes and fibroblasts. It turned out that the most promising inhibitor of collagenase and elastase enzymes was the extract from Aegopodium podagraria, which inhibits the activity of both enzymes by over 70\% in the concentration of 5\% positively affecting the condition of skin cells.},

	abstract = {Natural colorants/pigments such as anthocyanins, carotenoids, betalains, and chlorophylls have been generally used in the food industry as coloring agents. However, there are challenges related to color fading during food processing, storage, and commercialization due to the low stability of natural colorants compared to synthetic ones. Among them, anthocyanins are potential food colorants due to their color, low toxicity, and biological properties. However, the low chemical and thermal stability of anthocyanins have limited their use on a commercial scale. Copigmentation is the most commonly used technique for anthocyanin stabilization. This technique provides many advantages associated with the stability of anthocyanins. Natural anthocyanin pigments and copigments (e.g. polymers, phenolic compounds, and carbohydrates) form non-covalent complexes, which stabilize and modulate colors in a wide range of plants, fruits, and food products derived from them (including wines, jams, purees, and syrups). Over the past decade, research studies have been conducted to understand the molecular structure of copigment and the mechanism of copigmentation. This review summarizes this phenomenon to provide a comprehensive description of the interactions between anthocyanin and copigment (the dispersion and electrostatic components of π − π stacking, the hydrophobic effect, and hydrogen-bonding) occurring in copigmentation complexes. The trend of integrating copigmentation and encapsulation has been recently started to develop. In this paper, we also attempt to provide a comprehensive view of the effective approaches including spray and freeze-drying, emulsification, gelation, and their combinations for encapsulating copigmented anthocyanins.},

Nowadays natural is not a main concept of cosmetics any more, it is just required basic factor. The more advanced marketing concept of cosmetics is “Organic” which is including quality of materials, environment and pureness. The organic cosmetics have been known for customers for several years, but unfortunately, the word “Organic” was prohibited for using by government because there was no definition and regulation. But organic cosmetic certification body named {ECO}-{CERT} from France had definition for organic cosmetics starting around 2003. Ecocert is doing inspection and certification for manufacturer with very high qualified verification system, so their certified organic cosmetics are getting well known for {EU}, {USA} and others. When we think about the Jeju island, it has good image for clean, pure and beautiful. So it is the right time for Jeju to pay attention for organic cosmetics certified by Ecocert with their unique and special local products.},

Green Chemistry is, therefore, closely connected to environmental, economic and social sustainability. Moreover, consumers in the cosmetics field have become more aware of environmental concerns, and have thus pushed the industry to evolve towards “greener” products. This review compares the main cosmetic certifications ({COSMOS}, {NATRUE}, {ICEA}, {VEGANOK} and {EU} {ECOLABEL}) for green cosmetics, which are made up of natural/organic, vegetarian/vegan and ecological products, and contextualises them within the current legislation framework, including {ISO} 16128. Moreover, other relevant aspects of green cosmetics, including consumer perception and market concerns, have been analysed with an eye to the influence of cosmetic certifications. Although green marketing is correctly being promoted by several cosmetic companies because of increasing public awareness, the phenomenon of Greenwashing, which entails deceptive marketing, can occur when consumers are misled by the existence of different and not-yet-harmonised cosmetic standards.},

Beyond serving as a physical barrier component, keratinocytes actively participate in maintaining tissue homeostasis, shaping, amplifying, and regulating immune responses in skin. Keratinocytes act as sentinels, continuously monitoring changes in the environment, and, through microbial sensing, stretch, or other physical stimuli, can initiate a broad range of inflammatory responses via secretion of various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. This diverse function of keratinocytes contributes to the highly variable clinical manifestation of skin immune responses.

	abstract = {{SIGNIFICANCE}: Chronic exposure to environmental ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) plays a key role in both photocarcinogenesis and induction of accelerated skin aging. Although the spatiotemporal consequences of {UVR} exposure for the composition and architecture of the dermal extracellular matrix ({ECM}) are well characterized, the pathogenesis of photoaging remains poorly defined. Given the compelling evidence for the role of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) as mediators of photoaging, {UVR}-exposed human skin may be an accessible model system in which to characterize the role of oxidative damage in both internal and external tissues.
{RECENT} {ADVANCES}: Although the cell-mediated degradation of dermal components via {UVR}-induced expression of {ECM} proteases has long been identified as an integral part of the photoaging pathway, the relative importance and identity of cellular and extracellular photosensitizers (direct hit and bystanders models, respectively) in initiating this enzymatic activity is unclear. Recently, both age-related protein glycation and relative amino-acid composition have been identified as potential risk factors for photo-ionization and/or photo-sensitization. Here, we propose a selective multi-hit model of photoaging.
{CRITICAL} {ISSUES}: Bioinformatic analyses can be employed to identify candidate {UVR} targets/photosensitizers, but the action of {UVR} on protein structure and/or {ROS} production should be verified experimentally. Crucially, in the case of biochemically active {ECM} components such as fibronectin and fibrillin, the downstream effects of photo-degradation on tissue homeostasis remain to be confirmed.
{FUTURE} {DIRECTIONS}: Both topical antioxidants and inhibitors of detrimental cell signaling may be effective in abrogating the effects of specific {UVR}-mediated protein degradation in the dermis.},

	abstract = {This book is a formulary describing 35 preparations covering the safe treatment of a broad range of skin diseases. The formulary focuses on effective and cheap preparations, suitable for local production and use under tropical conditions.  
If you want to use this book, you can either download it for free (see below), or you can order your own hard copy by sending an email to Wewi-fwn@rug.nl, mentioning your name, address, email address, occupation and intended use of the book. It will be delivered free of charge to those working as health care professionals in developing countries or regions. Others will be charged €15,- for production and shipping costs.

Skin diseases are among the most common reasons for seeking medical advice in developing countries and regions. Although skin diseases are, in general, not life threatening, they may cause considerable discomfort and often have serious social implications. The potential demand for skin preparations is very high among large sections of the world’s population, which are economically disadvantaged and have little financial security.

Not much scientific work has been done to determine which effective, cheap and simple dermatological preparations are suitable for the conditions that exist in tropical environments. This formulary is a step in that direction. The recommendations in the book are based on the most current scientific information available, our own investigations and practical experience. The formulary aims to help meet the basic dermatological needs in primary and secondary health care in developing countries and regions around the world.

The first part of the book focuses on dermatological indications, preparations and therapy. It provides background information for the preparations considering efficacy, stability, and simplicity. The second part is a practical manual for the preparation and dispensing of the proposed dermatologicals. It also includes basic pharmaceutical methods and standards of Good Manufacturing Practice. The third part contains monographs of the preparations and raw materials. Master production forms are included in the electronic version of the book and are found on the {CD} that comes with the book.

This book can serve many purposes. It may be used as a textbook for teaching dermatological therapy or as a manual to set up a local production unit. More specifically, it may help medical doctors, pharmacists, nurses, clinical officers and other health care workers to jointly develop local drug policies and formularies for dermatologicals, and design local production facilities.


This formulary is a publication of the Beta Science Shop of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. The book comes with a {CD} containing master production forms for all preparations and a pdf file of the book itself.

The high adsorption and medium desorption capacities of carnosic acid and carnosol as well as antibacterial and antiradical activity from the extract obtained with choline chloride:lactic acid (1:2) on {XAD}7HP resin indicated that resin was appropriate. To get the optimal separation process, the influence of factors such as adsorption/desorption time and volume of desorbent was further investigated. The results showed that the extract with high antiradical and antibacterial activity was obtained via adsorption and desorption on {XAD}7HP resin. The extraction efficiencies of the deep eutectic solvents ({DESs}) recycled once, twice, and thrice were 97.64\% (±0.03\%), 93.10\% (±0.66\%), and 88.94\% (±1.15\%), respectively, for carnosic acid, and 96.63\% (±0.04\%), 94.38\% (±0.27\%), and 91.19\% (±0.36\%), respectively, for carnosol, relative to the initial solvent efficiency. Based on that, this method is a promising basis for the large-scale preparation of extracts from Salvia officinalis with further application in the pharmaceutical or food industry, especially for maintaining the “green” character of the whole process to obtain the appropriate extract.},

Therefore, we attempted to prepare the Gla dissolving microneedles (Gla-{MN}) to improve the absorbtion of Gla. After investigation of the 3 factors including the needle tip matrix concentration, the prescription concentration of backing material, and the dissolution method of Gla, we finally determined the process parameters of 10\% hyaluronic acid ({HA}) as the needle tip and 5\% polyvinyl alcohol ({PVA}) as the backing, according to which the Gla-{MN} was prepared with the good characteristics of high hardness, complete appearance and good in vitro dissolution ability. We then loaded Gla onto the microneedles and measured that the average drug loading of Gla-{MN} was 2.26 ± 0.11 μg/mg and the cumulative transdermal release of Gla-{MN} was up to 76.9\% after 24 h. In addition, Gla-{MN} had good skin penetration properties, with Gla-{MN} penetrating at least 4 to 5 layers of parafilm. And the skin basically could return to normal after 4 h of piercing. Importantly, our results showed that Gla-{MN} had higher transdermal delivery and therapeutic effects against keloid than that of Gla at the same dosage.},

	abstract = {α-Bisabolol (α{BIS}), a plant-derived compound with anti-inflammatory properties, is potentially a therapeutic agent for Atopic dermatitis. However, its poor water solubility and photoinstability limit its topical application. Therefore, the present study, aimed to develop cationic polymeric nanocapsules of α{BIS} to improve its skin delivery, photostability, and therapeutic efficacy. The α{BIS}-loaded nanocapsules were prepared using the solvent displacement technique. A Box-Behnken ({BB}) design was employed to statistically optimize formulation variables and α{BIS}-loaded nanocapsules characterized by particle size, surface charge and encapsulation efficiency. The optimal formulation was selected, and the spherical shape of the nanocapsules was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}). Furthermore, hydrogel containing α{BIS}-loaded nanocapsules was prepared by thickening of nanocapsule suspension with Carbopol 934 and evaluated for rheology, in vitro drug release and skin permeation. Furthermore, a mice model of atopic dermatitis was used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of the hydrogels. The optimal formulation displayed a spherical morphology under scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) with an optimum particle size of 133.00 nm, polydispersity index ({PDI}) of 0.12, high {EE}\% of 93 \%, and improved optical stability of α{BIS} in the prepared nanocapsules compared to the free drug. The nano-based hydrogels demonstrated non-Newtonian pseudoplastic behavior and an increased α{BIS} in vitro release profile without causing skin irritation in rabbits. Drug retention within the dermis and epidermis layers significantly surpassed that of drug-free hydrogel. Moreover, in vivo histopathological studies and myeloperoxidase ({MPO}) enzyme activity, revealed that hydrogel containing bisabolol nanocapsules exhibited The best anti-inflammatory effect. The results showed that hydrogels containing bisabolol nanocapsules markedly alleviated dermatitis-related inflammation and reduced skin thickness in Balb/c mice. Our findings support nanocapsules as an effective drug delivery system to enhance α{BIS} stability, bioavailability, and therapeutic efficacy in {AD} treatment.},

	abstract = {This report summarizes recent advances in the understanding of the structure and organization of the microvasculature in developing human skin. Previous observations suggested that the skin contains no blood vessels as late as eight weeks estimated gestational age ({EGA}). Computer reconstructions, in conjunction with light and transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}), however, demonstrated that specimens as young as 35-45 d show a level of vascular complexity previously unknown. The computer reconstructions showed that the vasculature was organized in one or two planes parallel to the epidermis. A simple, single plane was evident in specimens 40-50 d {EGA}, whereas specimens 50-75 d {EGA} showed two planes. Fewer vessels were continuous throughout the tissue sample in the younger specimens compared with the older specimens. Superior views highlighted the continuities and connections of vessels. The younger specimens showed more discontinuous segments of vessels when compared with the network established in the older specimens. In the earliest specimens examined morphologically (35-40 d), simple, capillarylike vessels were morphologically identifiable in presumptive dermis. The samples studied by {TEM} revealed detailed structure of the vessel wall including extreme attenuations and projections, plasmalemmal vesicles, and junctions similar to adult endothelial cells. Little or no basal lamina surrounded the vessel. The basal lamina first appeared in the form of amorphous deposits and eventually thickened and became continuous. By the end of the first trimester, the basal lamina still lacked the organization of adult cutaneous arterial and venous segments. These findings suggest that the major vascular organization of the dermis is defined in the first trimester of development.},

This study examined photoprotective effects of ellagic acid on collagen breakdown and inflammatory responses in {UV} (ultraviolet)-B irradiated human skin cells and hairless mice. Ellagic acid attenuated the {UV}-B-induced toxicity of {HaCaT} keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts. Non-toxic ellagic acid markedly prevented collagen degradation by blocking matrix metalloproteinase production in {UV}-B-exposed fibroblasts. Anti-wrinkle activity of ellagic acid was further investigated in hairless mice exposed to {UV}-B, in which it attenuated {UV}-B-triggered skin wrinkle formation and epidermal thickening. Topical application of 10 micromol/l ellagic acid diminished production of pro-inflammatory cytokines {IL}-1beta and {IL}-6, and blocked infiltration of inflammatory macrophages in the integuments of {SKH}-1 hairless mice exposed to {UV}-B for 8 weeks. In addition, this compound mitigated inflammatory intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression in {UV}-B-irradiated keratinocytes and photoaged mouse epidermis. These results demonstrate that ellagic acid prevented collagen destruction and inflammatory responses caused by {UV}-B. Therefore, dietary and pharmacological interventions with berries rich in ellagic acid may be promising treatment strategies interrupting skin wrinkle and inflammation associated with chronic {UV} exposure leading to photoageing.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previous studies on the age-, climate, and skin care habit-related changes of biophysical parameters have mainly focused on Caucasians, and studies on Asians are in paucity.
{OBJECTIVE}: This study was aimed to investigate the variations of cutaneous biophysical parameters in Chinese and Korean women (northeast Asians) and to assess the association between those parameters and age, climate, and cosmetic habits.
{METHODS}: A cross-sectional study included 361 healthy Chinese and Korean women between 18 and 49 years of age in 4 cities (Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Shijiazhuang in China, and Suwon in Korea). We measured skin surface temperature, hydration, transepidermal water loss ({TEWL}), sebum, elasticity, skin pore, wrinkle, and skin tone (brightness) using non-invasive instruments. Demographic profiles and cosmetic habits were assessed using a questionnaire.
{RESULTS}: Skin elasticity and tone decreased, and pore size and wrinkle increased with age. Subjects in Suwon (Korean) showed higher hydration level, lower {TEWL} and lower sebum, less severe wrinkle and brighter skin than those in the 3 cities in China. After adjusting for age and region, using sunscreen everyday, wearing base makeup daily, and using moisturizers improved hydration, {TEWL}, and elasticity significantly.
{CONCLUSION}: Women in Suwon (Korea) were found to have a better profile of biophysical parameters than women in the 3 Chinese cities, which might be attributed to cosmetic habits, besides age and climatic factors. The fact that appropriate cosmetic habits are associated with favorable skin biophysical parameters underscores the importance of daily skin care routine in preserving skin functions.},

	abstract = {The inner cell mass of the blastocyst has differentiated into epiblast and hypoblast (primitive endoderm) prior to implantation. Since endoderm cells extend beyond the epiblast, it can be considered that both parietal and visceral endoderm are present. At implantation, epiblast cells begin to show marked evidence of polarity. They form a spherical aggregate with their basal ends toward the basal lamina and apical ends toward the interior. The potential for an internal space is formed by this change in polarity of the cells. No cytological evidence of separation of those cells that will form amniotic epithelium from the rest of the epiblast is seen until a cavity begins to form. The amniotic epithelium is originally contiguous with overlying cytotrophoblast, and a diverticulum remains in this position during early development. Epiblast forms a pseudostratified columnar epithelium, but dividing cells are situated toward the amniotic cavity rather than basally. The first evidence of a trilaminar disc occurs when a strand of cells contiguous with epiblast is found extending toward visceral endoderm. These presumptive mesoderm cells are undifferentiated, whereas extraembryonic mesoderm cells are already a distinct population forming extracellular materials. After implantation, visceral endoderm cells proliferate forming an irregular layer one to three cells thick. Visceral endoderm cells have smooth apical surfaces, but very irregular basal surfaces, and no basal lamina. At the margins of the disc, visceral endoderm is continuous with parietal endoderm and reflects back over the apices of the marginal visceral endoderm cells. This sacculation by visceral endoderm cells precedes pinching off of the secondary yolk sac from the remaining primary yolk sac.},

Here, we identified and characterized two missing enzymes ({UGT}94M2 and {UGT}94BE1) in the asiaticoside, madecassoside and asiaticoside B biosynthetic pathway, which sequentially added glucosyl moiety of {UDP}-Glucose and {UDP}-Rhamnose to the monoglucosides of asiatic acid (1), madecassic acid (5) and terminolic acid (9) in C. asiatica at C-28, respectively. Additionally, the multienzyme one-pot reaction was used to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway and generate the asiaticoside (4), madecassoside (8), asiaticoside B (12) and intermediate compounds, and the conversion rates for asiatic acid, madecassic acid and terminolic acid with {UGT}73AD1, {UGT}94M2 and {UGT}94BE1 was 77 \%, 84 \% and 82 \%, respectively.

Fusiform pieces of the skin, 3-mm wide, were obtained at the midpupillary line, 7 mm above the eyelashes, during blepharoplasty. The specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Thickness of the skin was measured by a micrometer under a microscope. It was substantially the same in all of the age groups. The thickness varied from 818 +/- 85 microm in subjects 60 years or older to 884 +/- 112 microm in subjects between 21-and 30-years old; the mean was 860 +/- 305 microm. Thickness of the epidermis varied from 46 +/- 6 microm in subjects between 41- and 50-years old to 52 +/- 10 microm in subjects between 31- and 40-years old; the mean was 49 +/- 9 microm. There were no significant differences among the age groups (P = 0.440). Thickness of the dermis varied from 771 +/- 78 microm in subjects older than 61 years to 834 +/- 112 microm in subjects between 21-and 30-years old; the mean was 811 +/- 117 microm. There were no significant differences between the age groups (P = 0.553). It is noticeable that upper eyelid skin thickness is not affected remarkably by aging.},

	abstract = {Background Research has demonstrated the anti-photoaging properties of glabridin and bakuchiol. Methods The impact of glabridin, glabridin + bakuchiol, and bakuchiol on the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha ({TNF}-α) and interleukin-1 beta ({IL}-1β) in mice skin fibroblasts was observed. Furthermore, we investigated the potential roles of fibronectin ({FN}), interferon-γ ({IFN}-γ), interleukin-22 ({IL}-22), and transforming growth factor-β ({TGF}-β) in the tissues, and evaluated their impact on the enzymatic levels in the skin. In conjunction with transcriptomic analysis, metabolomic profiling, and network pharmacology, all samples underwent comprehensive metabolomic and principal component analysis. The Venny2.1 method was utilized to identify variances in shared metabolites between the treatment group and the {UVB} group, as well as between the {UVB} group and the control group. Subsequently, a cluster heat map was generated to forecast and analyze metabolic pathways and targets. Results The outcomes from the hematoxylin and eosin and toluidine blue staining revealed that glabridin and bakuchiol markedly decreased dermal thickness and suppressed mast cell infiltration in photoaged mice. Immunohistochemistry and Elisa analysis revealed that glabridin and bakuchiol effectively attenuated the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, including {IL}-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, {IL}-22, and {IFN}-γ. Furthermore, an increase in the levels of anti-inflammatory factors such as {FN} and {TGF}-β was also observed. The determination of the contents of superoxide dismutase, hydroxypropyltransferase and malondialdehyde in mice dorsal skin revealed that glabridin and bakuchiol not only elevated the levels of superoxide dismutase and hydroxyproline, but also reduced malondialdehyde content. Due to the limited number of shared differential metabolites exclusively within Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, comprehensive pathway enrichment analysis was not feasible. Conclusion This study demonstrates that glabridin and bakuchiol effectively impede photoaging and alleviate skin inflammation in mice.},

	abstract = {Natural oils are advocated and used throughout the world as part of neonatal skin care, but there is an absence of evidence to support this practice. The goal of the current study was to ascertain the effect of olive oil and sunflower seed oil on the biophysical properties of the skin. Nineteen adult volunteers with and without a history of atopic dermatitis were recruited into two randomized forearm-controlled mechanistic studies. The first cohort applied six drops of olive oil to one forearm twice daily for 5 weeks. The second cohort applied six drops of olive oil to one forearm and six drops of sunflower seed oil to the other twice daily for 4 weeks. The effect of the treatments was evaluated by determining stratum corneum integrity and cohesion, intercorneocyte cohesion, moisturization, skin-surface {pH}, and erythema. Topical application of olive oil for 4 weeks caused a significant reduction in stratum corneum integrity and induced mild erythema in volunteers with and without a history of atopic dermatitis. Sunflower seed oil preserved stratum corneum integrity, did not cause erythema, and improved hydration in the same volunteers. In contrast to sunflower seed oil, topical treatment with olive oil significantly damages the skin barrier, and therefore has the potential to promote the development of, and exacerbate existing, atopic dermatitis. The use of olive oil for the treatment of dry skin and infant massage should therefore be discouraged. These findings challenge the unfounded belief that all natural oils are beneficial for the skin and highlight the need for further research.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Hospitalized preterm infants with compromised skin barrier function treated topically with sunflower seed oil ({SSO}) have shown reductions in sepsis and neonatal mortality rate ({NMR}). Mustard oil and products commonly used in high-mortality settings may possibly harm skin barrier integrity and enhance risk of infection and mortality in newborn infants. We hypothesized that {SSO} therapy may reduce {NMR} in such settings.
{METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS}: This was a population-based, cluster randomized, controlled trial in 276 clusters in rural Uttar Pradesh, India. All newborn infants identified through population-based surveillance in the study clusters within 7 days of delivery were enrolled from November 2014 to October 2016. Exclusive, 3 times daily, gentle applications of 10 ml of {SSO} to newborn infants by families throughout the neonatal period were recommended in intervention clusters (n = 138 clusters); infants in comparison clusters (n = 138 clusters) received usual care, such as massage practice typically with mustard oil. Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat with {NMR} and post-24-hour {NMR} as the primary outcomes. Secondary analysis included per-protocol analysis and subgroup analyses for {NMR}. Regression analysis was adjusted for caste, first-visit weight, delivery attendant, gravidity, maternal age, maternal education, sex of the infant, and multiple births. We enrolled 13,478 (52.2\% male, mean weight: 2,575.0 grams ± standard deviation [{SD}] 521.0) and 13,109 (52.0\% male, mean weight: 2,607.0 grams ± {SD} 509.0) newborn infants in the intervention and comparison clusters, respectively. We found no overall difference in {NMR} in the intervention versus the comparison clusters [adjusted odds ratio ({aOR}) 0.96, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.84 to 1.11, p = 0.61]. Acceptance of {SSO} in the intervention arm was high at 89.3\%, but adherence to exclusive applications of {SSO} was 30.4\%. Per-protocol analysis showed a significant 58\% (95\% {CI} 42\% to 69\%, p {\textless} 0.01) reduction in mortality among infants in the intervention group who were treated exclusively with {SSO} as intended versus infants in the comparison group who received exclusive applications of mustard oil. A significant 52\% (95\% {CI} 12\% to 74\%, p = 0.02) reduction in {NMR} was observed in the subgroup of infants weighing ≤1,500 g (n = 589); there were no statistically significant differences in other prespecified subgroup comparisons by low birth weight ({LBW}), birthplace, and wealth. No severe adverse events ({SAEs}) were attributable to the intervention. The study was limited by inability to mask allocation to study workers or participants and by measurement of emollient use based on caregiver responses and not actual observation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In this trial, we observed that promotion of {SSO} therapy universally for all newborn infants was not effective in reducing {NMR}. However, this result may not necessarily establish equivalence between {SSO} and mustard oil massage in light of our secondary findings. Mortality reduction in the subgroup of infants ≤1,500 g was consistent with previous hospital-based efficacy studies, potentially extending the applicability of emollient therapy in very low-birth-weight ({VLBW}) infants along the facility-community continuum. Further research is recommended to develop and evaluate therapeutic regimens and continuum of care delivery strategies for emollient therapy for newborn infants at highest risk of compromised skin barrier function.

Tween\&reg; 80 and five blends of Tween\&reg; 80/Span\&reg; 80 and Tween\&reg; 80/Span\&reg; 85 in the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance ({HLB}) value range of 10.7\&ndash;14.0 were selected to study the phase diagram behavior of palm kernel oil esters using the water titration method at room temperature.Results: High solubilization capacity was obtained by Tween\&reg; 80 compared with other surfactants of Tween\&reg; series. High {HLB} blends of Tween\&reg; 80/Span\&reg; 85 and Tween\&reg; 80/Span\&reg; 80 at {HLB} 13.7 and 13.9, respectively, have better solubilization capacity compared with the lower {HLB} values of Tween\&reg; 80/Span\&reg; 80. All the selected blends of surfactants were formed as water-in-oil microemulsions, and other dispersion systems varied in size and geometrical layout in the triangles. The high solubilization capacity and larger areas of the water-in-oil microemulsion systems were due to the structural similarity between the lipophilic tail of Tween\&reg; 80 and the oleyl group of the palm kernel oil esters.Conclusion: This study suggests that the phase diagram behavior of palm kernel oil esters, water, and nonionic surfactants is not only affected by the {HLB} value, but also by the structural similarity between palm kernel oil esters and the surfactant used. The information gathered in this study is useful for researchers and manufacturers interested in using palm kernel oil esters in pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparation. The use of palm kernel oil esters can improve drug delivery and reduce the cost of cosmetics.Keywords: phase diagram, palm kernel oil esters, nonionic surfactants, microemulsions},

Various air pollutants such as ultraviolet radiation, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, oxides, particulate matter, ozone and cigarette smoke affect the skin as it is the outermost barrier. Air pollutants damage the skin by inducing oxidative stress. Although human skin acts as a biological shield against pro-oxidative chemicals and physical air pollutants, prolonged or repetitive exposure to high levels of these pollutants may have profound negative effects on the skin. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation has been associated with extrinsic skin aging and skin cancers. Cigarette smoke contributes to premature aging and an increase in the incidence of psoriasis, acne and skin cancers. It is also implicated in allergic skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and eczema. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are associated with extrinsic skin aging, pigmentation, cancers and acneiform eruptions. Volatile organic compounds have been associated with atopic dermatitis.

	abstract = {Catechin is a flavan-3-ol, a derivative of flavans, with four phenolic hydroxyl groups, which exhibits a wide range of physiological properties. Chromatographic analyses were employed to examine the effects of blue light irradiation on the changes of catechin hydrate in an alkaline condition. In particular, the detection of a superoxide anion radical (O2•−), a reactive oxygen species ({ROS}), and the inactivation of Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii)—including a carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii ({CRAB})—was investigated during the photoreaction of catechin hydrate. Following basification with blue light irradiation, the transparent solution of catechin hydrate turned yellowish, and a chromogenic catechin dimer was separated and identified as a proanthocyanidin. Adding ascorbic acid during the photolytic treatment of catechin hydrate decreased the dimer formation, suggesting that ascorbic acid can suppress the photosensitive oxidation of catechin. When catechin hydrate was irradiated by blue light in an alkaline solution, O2•− was produced via photosensitized oxidation, enhancing the inactivation of A. baumannii and {CRAB}. The present findings on the photon-induced oxidation of catechin hydrate provides a safe practice for the inactivation of environmental microorganisms.},

	abstract = {Oxidants play a crucial role in the development of oxidative stress, which is linked to disease progression. Ellagic acid is an effective antioxidant with applications in the treatment and prevention of several diseases, since it neutralizes free radicals and reduces oxidative stress. However, it has limited application due to its poor solubility and oral bioavailability. Since ellagic acid is hydrophobic, it is difficult to load it directly into hydrogels for controlled release applications. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to first prepare inclusion complexes of ellagic acid ({EA}) with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and then load them into carbopol-934-grafted-2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid ({CP}-g-{AMPS}) hydrogels for orally controlled drug delivery. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ({FTIR}), X-ray diffraction ({XRD}), scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}), thermogravimetric analysis ({TGA}), and differential scanning calorimetry ({DSC}) were used to validate ellagic acid inclusion complexes and hydrogels. There was slightly higher swelling and drug release at {pH} 1.2 (42.20\% and 92.13\%) than at {pH} 7.4 (31.61\% and 77.28\%), respectively. Hydrogels had high porosity (88.90\%) and biodegradation (9.2\% per week in phosphate-buffered saline). Hydrogels were tested for their antioxidant properties in vitro against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ({DPPH}) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) ({ABTS}). Additionally, the antibacterial activity of hydrogels was demonstrated against Gram-positive bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and Gram-negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa).},

This work aimed to clarify the skin anti-photoaging properties of {EA} in human dermal fibroblasts. The skin anti-photoaging activity was evaluated by analyzing the reactive oxygen species ({ROS}), matrix metalloproteinase-2 ({MMP}-2), total glutathione ({GSH}) and superoxide dismutase ({SOD}) activity levels as well as cell viability in dermal fibroblasts under {UV}-B irradiation. When fibroblasts were exposed to {EA} prior to {UV}-B irradiation, {EA} suppressed {UV}-B-induced {ROS} and {proMMP}-2 elevation. However, {EA} restored total {GSH} and {SOD} activity levels diminished in fibroblasts under {UV}-B irradiation. {EA} had an up-regulating activity on the {UV}-B-reduced Nrf2 levels in fibroblasts. {EA}, at the concentrations used, was unable to interfere with cell viabilities in both non-irradiated and irradiated fibroblasts. In human dermal fibroblasts, {EA} plays a defensive role against {UV}-B-induced oxidative stress possibly through an Nrf2-dependent pathway, indicating that this compound has potential skin antiphotoaging properties.},

	abstract = {{UV} radiation from the sun is a potent environmental risk factor in the pathogenesis of skin damage. Much of the skin damage caused by ultraviolet A ({UVA}) irradiation from the sun is associated with oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective role of ellagic acid (25–75{μM}), a natural antioxidant, against {UVA} (5–20J/cm2)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in human keratinocyte ({HaCaT}) cells and to reveal the possible mechanisms underlying this protective efficacy. Ellagic acid pre-treatment markedly increased {HaCaT} cell viability and suppressed {UVA}-induced {ROS} generation and {MDA} formation. Moreover, ellagic acid pre-treatment prevented {UVA}-induced {DNA} damage as evaluated by the comet assay. Ellagic acid treatment also significantly inhibited the {UVA}-induced apoptosis of {HaCaT} cells, as measured by a reduction of {DNA} fragmentation, mitochondria dysfunction, {ER} stress, caspase-3 activation, and Bcl-2/Bax deregulation. Notably, the antioxidant potential of ellagic acid was directly correlated with the increased expression of {HO}-1 and {SOD}, which was followed by the downregulation of Keap1 and the augmented nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of Nrf2 with or without {UVA} irradiation. Nrf2 knockdown diminished the protective effects of ellagic acid. Therefore, ellagic acid may be useful for the treatment of {UVA}-induced skin damage.},

In recent years, ellagic acid ({EA}) has gained attention due to its multiple biological activities and several molecular targets. This is the first review focused on the pharmacological properties and on the molecular mechanisms activated by {EA} in terms of liver protection. {EA} possesses antioxidant, antihepatotoxic, antisteatosic, anticholestatic, antifibrogenic, antihepatocarcinogenic and antiviral properties that improves the hepatic architectural and functions against toxic and pathological conditions. The molecular mechanisms that {EA} activates include the scavenging of free radicals, regulation of phase I and {II} enzymes, modulation of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines synthesis, the regulation of biochemical pathways involved in the synthesis and degradation of lipids as well as the maintenance of essential trace elements levels. {EA} also inhibits hepatic stellate cells and mast cells activation, the proliferation of transformed cells, as well as viral replication by increasing antioxidant response, induction of apoptosis, downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle and angiogenesis, and stimulation of cellular immune response. Despite the enormous therapeutic potential of {EA} as an innovative pharmacological strategy, the number of phase I and {II} trials in patients is scarce, precluding its clinical application. In these sense, the use of new delivery systems that enhances {EA} bioavailability would improve the results already obtained. Also it remains to be determined if treatment with urolithins instead of {EA} would represent a better strategy in hepatic disease treatment.},

Gastrulation is an early developmental process in which an embryo transforms from a one-dimensional layer of epithelial cells, a blastula, and reorganizes into a multilayered and multidimensional structure called the gastrula. In triploblastic organisms such as reptiles, avians, and mammals, gastrulation attains a three tissue-layered organism composed of endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Each germ layer corresponds to the development of specific primitive systems during organogenesis. In addition to setting the embryo up for organ formation, gastrulation provides a mechanism to develop a multileveled body plan that demarcates anatomical axis formation. These axes are the dorsal/ventral axis, also termed the anterior/posterior or rostral/posterior axis, and the cranial/caudal or superior/inferior axis. Gastrulation also promotes the retention of global left and right symmetry and the loss of bilateral symmetry in specific organs such as the heart.},

Early stability, {pH}, droplet size distribution, rheology, tackiness, adhesivity, spreadability, tribology, and release profile of a lipophilic substance model (in Franz cells, through a synthetic membrane, for six hours) were assessed. The creams had acid epicutaneous {pH} and a “shear-thinning” “solid-like” viscoelastic behavior. Among the seven emollients’ properties, polarity, density, and viscosity were the most influential. Droplet parameters were the most impacted, {pH} and release were moderately affected, and the textural properties were lowly to moderately impacted. The emollient substitution in the model formulation affected the experimental parameters differently, allowing formulation optimization and tailoring its potential therapeutic performance regarding drug release, coadjutant effects, and dwell time on the skin. By looking at the creams’ characteristics, it was possible to select the best-suited emollients for releasing a lipophilic drug, applying on painful skin, and formulation in wash-off products or leave-on protective barrier creams.},

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of {AD} in adults and by disease severity.
Methods: This international, cross-sectional, web-based survey was performed in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, and Japan. Adult members of online respondent panels were sent a questionnaire for {AD} identification and severity assessment; demographic quotas ensured population representativeness for each country. A diagnosis of {AD} required subjects to be positive on the modified {UK} Working Party/{ISAAC} criteria and self-report of ever having an {AD} diagnosis by a physician. The proportion of subjects with {AD} who reported being treated for their condition was determined and also used to estimate prevalence. Severity scales were Patient-Oriented {SCORAD}, Patient-Orientated Eczema Measure, and Patient Global Assessment.
Results: Among participants by region, the point prevalence of adult {AD} in the overall/treated populations was 4.9\%/3.9\% in the {US}, 3.5\%/2.6\% in Canada, 4.4\%/3.5\% in the {EU}, and 2.1\%/1.5\% in Japan. The prevalence was generally lower for males vs females, and decreased with age. Regional variability was observed within countries. Severity varied by scale and region; however, regardless of the scale or region, proportion of subjects reporting severe disease was lower than mild or moderate disease.
Conclusions: Prevalence of adult {AD} ranged from 2.1\% to 4.9\% across countries. Severe {AD} represented a small proportion of the overall {AD} population regardless of measure or region.},

	abstract = {As the population of postmenopausal women increases, interest in the effects of estrogen grows. The influence of estrogen on several body systems has been well-documented; however, one area that has not been explored is the effects of estrogen on skin. Estrogen appears to aid in the prevention of skin aging in several ways. This reproductive hormone prevents a decrease in skin collagen in postmenopausal women; topical and systemic estrogen therapy can increase the skin collagen content and therefore maintain skin thickness. In addition, estrogen maintains skin moisture by increasing acid mucopolysaccharides and hyaluronic acid in the skin and possibly maintaining stratum corneum barrier function. Sebum levels are higher in postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy. Skin wrinkling also may benefit from estrogen as a result of the effects of the hormone on the elastic fibers and collagen. Outside of its influence on skin aging, it has been suggested that estrogen increases cutaneous wound healing by regulating the levels of a cytokine. In fact, topical estrogen has been found to accelerate and improve wound healing in elderly men and women. The role of estrogen in scarring is unclear but recent studies indicate that the lack of estrogen or the addition of tamoxifen may improve the quality of scarring. Unlike skin aging, the role of endogenous and exogenous estrogen in melanoma has not been well established.},

	abstract = {Centella asiatica ({CA}) or Gotu cola is an herbal plant from the Apiaceae family with a long history of usage in different traditional medicines. It has long been used for the treatment of various ailments such as central nervous system ({CNS}), skin and gastrointestinal disorders especially in the Southeast Asia. This chapter focused on the phytochemical constituent and pharmacological activities of {CA} based on preclinical and clinical studies. Additionally, botanical description and distribution, traditional uses, interactions, and safety issues are reviewed. Electronic databases of Google Scholar, Scopus, {PubMed}, and Web of Science were searched to obtain relevant studies on the pharmacological activities of {CA}. Approximately, 124 chemical compounds including triterpenoids, polyphenolic compounds, and essential oils have been isolated and identified from {CA}. Ethnomedicinal applications of {CA} mostly include treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, wounds, nervous system disorders, circulatory diseases, skin problems, respiratory ailments, diabetes and sleep disorders in various ethnobotanical practices. Pharmacological studies revealed a wide range of beneficial effects of {CA} on {CNS}, cardiovascular, lung, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal, skin, and endocrine system. Among them, neuroprotective activity, wound healing and treatment of venous insufficiency, as well as antidiabetic activity seem to be more frequently reported. At the moment, considering various health benefits of {CA}, it is marketed as an oral supplement as well as a topical ingredient in some cosmetic products. Additional preclinical studies and particularly randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the therapeutic roles of {CA}.},

	abstract = {An ethnopharmaceutical study focused on domestic cosmetics, cosmeceuticals, and remedies to heal skin diseases traditionally used in the inland part of the Marches region (Central-Eastern Italy) has been conducted. At present, traditional knowledge concerning home-made phytocosmetics is represented by both the remnants of an orally transmitted folk heritage and also by new forms of knowledge, sometimes coming from popular phytotherapeutical books and the mass media (out of the scope of this survey), but also as a result of recent migration trends from Eastern Europe. We recorded approximately 135 cosmetic or cosmeceutical preparations prepared from more than 70 botanical species and a very few animal or mineral ingredients. Among the recorded preparations, developing a clear distinction amongst cosmetics, cosmeceuticals and pharmaceuticals for skin diseases is very problematic, confirming that in folk knowledge systems medicinal products for healing skin diseases and cosmetics have often been perceived as two poles of a continuum. Many of the quoted species represented well-known medicinal plants of the European phytotherapy, although we also recorded a few unusual plant taxa, which are briefly discussed under the perspective of their eventual phytochemical and/or phytopharmacological potentialities. Exotic drugs or precious essences, even native of the Mediterranean, were not quoted as ingredients for preparing perfumes and fragrances by the interviewees of the present study, thus indicating that popular cosmetic practices in rural Central Italy have taken a much separated path away from the cosmetic “know-how” of the aristocracy and high bourgeois classes of the last centuries.},

Probably yes. Despite the spending of billions of {US} dollars, and three decades of efforts, high-throughput screenings have only allowed the discovery of a couple of drugs. One could have reasonably expected the discovery of an arsenal of drugs from the millions of plant extracts randomly tested, but “hits” can be inactive in vitro or too toxic, some molecules need to be metabolized first to be active, and false-positive and false-negative results are common. The bitter truth is that the robotic approach in discovering drugs from plants has proven, to date, its inability to excavate the hundreds of molecules that will contribute to the health progress of Man. However, one can reasonably see that the last patches of primary rainforest on earth hold still hundreds of spectacularly active drugs that await discovery.},

	abstract = {Objectives: 1. Assess French exposure to {IFs} and {ENL}, and validate tools for accurate estimation. 2. Investigate the endocrine effects of {IFs} and {ENL} in humans, focusing on systemic lupus erythematosus ({SLE}) and triple-negative breast cancer. 3. Develop techniques to reduce the {IFs} content of soy-based food products.
Methodology: 1. {IF} and {ENL} Exposure Assessment: - Food analyses and dietary intake assessment to quantify the French exposure to {IFs} and lignans. - Development and validation of food questionnaires to evaluate soy and lignans consumption. - Measurements of {IFs} and {ENL} in biological fluids (blood, urine) and hair. 2. Endocrine effects of {IFs} and {ENL}: - Case-control study on {SLE}, comparing {IFs} and {ENL} exposure in patients and in healthy controls. - In vitro studies on triple-negative breast cancer cells, analyzing the effect of {IFs} on cell proliferation and their interactions with the {GPER}, a membrane estrogen receptor. 3. Reduction of {IF} levels: - Development of (pre)industrial rinsing processes to decrease {IFs} content in soybeans. - Investigation of traditional Asian recipes and domestic water rinsing techniques for reducing {IFs} in soy-based foods.
Results: 1. {IFs} and Lignans exposure: - French exposure to {IFs} is significant, even for non-soy consumers, due to “hidden soy” in ultra-processed foods. - The developed food questionnaires are validated, and a method for {IFs} and {ENL} analysis in hair is presented. 2. Endocrine effects of {IFs} and {ENL}: - Preliminary findings from the {SLE} cohort suggest a potential association between {ENL} and a healthier status. However, the limited sample size necessitates further investigation to definitively exclude an impact of {IFs}. - {IFs} and their circulating conjugates might promote triple-negative breast cancer cells proliferation through the {GPER}. 3. Reducing {IF} levels: - Industrial rinsing processes can effectively reduce {IFs} content in soybean by 50\%. - Traditional Asian preparation methods and domestic rinsing significantly decrease {IFs} in soy-based products. Discussion: Soy consumption warrants specific attention due to the endocrine effects of {IFs}. Further research is crucial to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these effects and formulate recommendations for safe soy consumption.
Conclusion: While soy consumption holds nutritional value and boasts a long tradition in Asia, its high isoflavone content raises questions about its potential impact on human health. This thesis contributes preliminary insights into French exposure to {IFs}, their possible effects on {SLE} and triple-negative breast cancer, and proposes solutions for mitigating {IFs} levels in soy-based foods},

Although the exploitation of ochre is viewed as a key feature of the emergence of modern human behaviour, the uses to which ochre and ochre-based mixtures were put remain ambiguous. Here we present the results of an experimental study exploring the efficacy of ochre as a topical photoprotective compound. This is achieved through the in vivo calculation of the sun protection factor ({SPF}) values of ochre samples obtained from Ovahimba women (Kunene Region, Northern Namibia) and the Palaeozoic Bokkeveld Group deposits of the Cape Supergroup (Western Cape Province, South Africa). We employ visible spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence ({ED}-{XRF}), X-ray diffraction ({XRD}) and granulometric analyses to characterise ochre samples. The capacity of ochre to inhibit the susceptibility of humans to the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) is confirmed and the mechanisms implicated in the efficacy of ochre as a sunscreen identified. It is posited that the habitual application of ochre may have represented a crucial innovation for {MSA} humans by limiting the adverse effects of ultraviolet exposure. This may have facilitated the colonisation of geographic regions largely unfavourable to the constitutive skin colour of newly arriving populations.},

The extracts were treated with trifluoroacetic acid to hydrolyze the ellagic acid glucosides, and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}). Both acetone/water and continuous soxhlet extraction with methanol were equally effective in extracting ellagic acid from strawberries. In raspberries, the amount of ellagic acid liberated by the two extraction methods was not significantly different after hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid. The extracts were stable over 90 days at −20, 4, and 25°C. Analysis showed that every food sample tested contained ellagic acid, but only the amounts present in strawberries (630 μg), raspberries (1500 μg), blackberries (1500 μg), walnuts (590 μg), pecans (330 μg), and cranberries (120 μg ellagic acid/g dry wt) were within the calibration range of the assay.

	abstract = {Plant materials derived from the Aloe plant are used as cosmetic ingredients, including Aloe Andongensis Extract, Aloe Andongensis Leaf Juice, Aloe Arborescens Leaf Extract, Aloe Arborescens Leaf Juice, Aloe Arborescens Leaf Protoplasts, Aloe Barbadensis Flower Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Polysaccharides, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Water, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Juice, and Aloe Ferox Leaf Juice Extract. These ingredients function primarily as skin-conditioning agents and are included in cosmetics only at low concentrations. The Aloe leaf consists of the pericyclic cells, found just below the plant's skin, and the inner central area of the leaf, i.e., the gel, which is used for cosmetic products. The pericyclic cells produce a bitter, yellow latex containing a number of anthraquinones, phototoxic compounds that are also gastrointestinal irritants responsible for cathartic effects. The gel contains polysaccharides, which can be acetylated, partially acetylated, or not acetylated. An industry established limit for anthraquinones in aloe-derived material for nonmedicinal use is 50 ppm or lower. Aloe-derived ingredients are used in a wide variety of cosmetic product typesat concentrations of raw material that are 0.1\% or less, although can be as high as 20\%. The concentration of Aloe in the raw material also may vary from 100\% to a low of 0.0005\%. Oral administration of various anthraquinone components results in a rise in their blood concentrations, wide systemic distribution, accumulation in the liver and kidneys, and excretion in urine and feces; polysaccharide components are distributed systemically and metabolized into smaller molecules. aloe-derived material has fungicidal, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities, and has been effective in wound healing and infection treatment in animals. Aloe barbadensis (also known as Aloe vera)–derived ingredients were not toxic in acute oral studies using mice and rats. In parenteral studies, the {LD}50 using mice was {\textgreater} 200 mg/kg, rats was {\textgreater}50 mg/kg, and using dogs was {\textgreater}50 mg/kg. In intravenous studies the {LD}50 using mice was {\textgreater}80 mg/kg, rats was {\textgreater}15 mg/kg, and dogs was {\textgreater}10 mg/kg. The 14-day no observed effect level ({NOEL}) for the Aloe polysaccharide, acemannan, in the diet of {SpragueDawley} rats, was 50,000 ppm or 4.1 to 4.6 g/kg day-1. In a 3-month study using mice, Aloe vera (extracted in ethanol) given orally in drinking water at 100 mg/kg produced reproductive toxicity, inflammation, and mortality above that seen in control animals. Aloe vera extracted in methanol and given to mice at 100 mg/kg in drinking water for 3 months caused signi.cant sperm damage compared to controls. Aloe barbadensis extracted with water and given to pregnant Charles Foster albino rats on gestational days ({GDs}) 0 through 9 was an abortifacient and produced skeletal abnormalities. Both negative and positive results were found in bacterial and mammalian cell genotoxicity assays using Aloe barbadensis– derived material, Aloe Ferox–derived material, and various anthraquinones derived from Aloe. Aloin (an anthraquinone) did not produce tumors when included in the feed of mice for 20 weeks, nor did aloin increase the incidence of colorectal tumors induced with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. Aloe-emodin (an anthraquinone) given to mice in which tumor cells had been injected inhibited growth of malignant tumors. Other animal data also suggest that components of Aloe inhibit tumor growth and improve survival. Various in vitro assays also demonstrated anticarcinogenic activity of aloe-emodin. Diarrhea was the only adverse effect of note with the use of Aloe-derived ingredients to treat asthma, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, ulcers, skin disease, and cancer. Case reports include acute eczema, contact urticaria, and dermatitis in individuals who applied Aloe-derived ingredients topically. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded that anthraquinone levels in the several Aloe Barbadensis extracts are well understood and can conform to the industry-established level of 50 ppm. Although the phototoxicity anthraquinone components of Aloe plants have been demonstrated, several clinical studies of preparations derived from Aloe barbadensis plants demonstrated no phototoxicity, con.rming that the concentrations of anthraquinones in such preparations are too low to induce phototoxicity. The characterization of aloe-derived ingredients from other species is not clear. In the absence of well-characterized derivatives, biological studies of these materials are considered necessary. The studies needed are 28-day dermal toxicity studies on Aloe Andongensis Extract, Aloe Andongensis Leaf Juice, Aloe Arborescens Leaf Extract, Aloe Arborescens Leaf Juice, Aloe Ferox Leaf Extract, Aloe Ferox Leaf Juice, and Aloe Ferox Leaf Juice (ingredients should be tested at current use concentrations). In Aloe-derived ingredients used in cosmetics, regardless of species, anthraquinone levels should not exceed 50 ppm. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel advised the industry that the total polychlorobiphenyl ({PCB})/pesticide contamination of any plant-derived cosmetic ingredient should be limited to not more than 40 ppm, with not more than 10 ppm for any speci.c residue and that limits were appropriate for the following impurities: arsenic (3 mg/kg maximum), heavy metals (20 mg/kg maximum), and lead (5 mg/kg maximum).},

Animal studies demonstrate that Bisabolol is well absorbed following dermal exposure and one study using cadaver skin demonstrated that Bisabolol can enhance the penetration of 5-fluorouracil. Bisabolol was relatively nontoxic in acute oral studies in rats, dogs, and monkeys. Short-term oral exposure using rats did produce inflammatory changes in several organs, and reduced body weight and increased liver weights relative to body weight in dogs. The no-observable-adverse-effect level in a 28-day dermal toxicity study using rats was 200 mdkg/day. No evidence of sensitization or photosensitization was found. Bisabolol was negative in bacterial and mammalian genotoxicity tests, and it did not produce reproductive or developmental toxicity in rats. The results of oral and dermal toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive/developmental toxicity, sensitization, and photosensitization studies show little toxicity at levels expected in cosmetic formulafions. Formulators should be alert to the possibility that use of Bisabolol may increase the penetration of other components of a cosmetic formulation. Based on the available data it was concluded that Bisabolol is safe as used in cosmetic formulafions.},

	abstract = {Franz diffusion cell was primarily used to evaluate the permeability and stability of formulations such as topical (gels and creams) and transdermal (lipid nanoparticle formulations). Diffusion cell is a straightforward assay that can reliably measure the in-vitro and ex-vivo drug release from topical preparations such as creams, ointments, liposomes formulations, and gels. It offered crucial critical perspectives on skin, drug, and formulation relationships. In addition, it is also employed for toxicity testing and quality control. Currently, many medications are available in the market, administered through transdermal routes. To treat various skin conditions, medical professionals use a wide range of methods aimed at increasing the skin’s permeability and drug absorption. The biggest challenge with transdermal drug delivery system is determining the amount of medication penetrating the skin. Today, there is a lot of research into creating new dermal dosage forms for pharmaceuticals. In this review, the authors discuss various evaluation methods to determine the amount of drug penetrating the skin. With their strengths and weaknesses, these models and assessment methods provide a valuable framework for investigating the dermato-pharmacokinetics of different transdermal formulations. The assessment techniques aid in assessing molecules that cause skin irritation by shedding light on the molecular mechanisms by which they penetrate the skin. These assessment tools and models provide a novel strategy for creating topical medicinal formulations for various skin infection disorders. The present review explores Franz diffusion cell application, its implication in pharmaceutical research, and the regulation related to pharmacopeia.},

{METHODS}: A comprehensive search for epidemiological studies in {AD} was conducted in four electronic databases ({PubMed}, Embase, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure). A Bayesian hierarchical linear mixed model was constructed to calculate epidemiological estimates of {AD} considering the heterogeneity of regions, countries, type of diagnoses and age strata.
{RESULTS}: In total, 344 studies met the inclusion criteria. Incidence varied substantially with the location and age of the surveyed participants. The global prevalence of {AD} and the population affected by {AD} were estimated to be 2.6\% [95\% uncertainty interval ({UI}) 1.9-3.5] and 204.05 million people, respectively. Around 101.27 million adults and 102.78 million children worldwide have {AD}, corresponding to prevalence rates of 2.0\% (95\% {UI} 1.4-2.6) and 4.0\% (95\% {UI} 2.8-5.3), respectively.

	abstract = {Pre-colonial patterns of trade in West Africa included exchanges of shea in periodic local and regional markets. The collection, processing and marketing of shea products in such markets continues to be predominantly by women to both meet subsistence needs, and exchange of surpluses. In the early part of the 20th century, the British colonial administration considered the possibilities of starting large-scale exports of shea kernels to Europe. Multiple colonial initiatives to develop the global trade were not successful due to a composite of factors. Contemporary patterns of production, trade and regulation are contrasted in the context of globalisation in the post-independence era. The government of Ghana has progressively reinforced its ambitions to expand the shea nut trade as part of the state’s portfolio of major non-traditional agricultural export commodities. This policy is embedded within the (now) dominant orthodoxy of neo-liberalism, which privileges monetized production systems and private over public regulation. Historically and culturally-embedded patterns of shea production and trade by women in northern Ghana may now be challenged by the emergence of new processing technologies, the emergence of an oligopolistic global commodity chain and the anticipated continued growth in global demand for cocoa butter equivalents.  Nevertheless, the cumulative impacts of increasing commercialisation and world market integration at the national and local level in Ghana, and other West African producer countries, are still unknown. There are risks, however, that this process may result in social differentiation, changes in household consumption patterns and loss of livelihoods, particularly for women.},

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance
Glycyrrhiza glabra. L is a traditional herbal medicine widely recognized for its skin-whitening properties; however, the specific active compounds and underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects remain largely uncharacterized.
Aim of the study
To identify the bioactive constituents in G. glabra extract ({GGE}) responsible for its depigmenting effects and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying their skin-whitening activity.
Methods
The depigmenting activity of {GGE} was assessed through {NaOH} lysis, {DOPA} oxidation assays, and high-performance liquid chromatography for component identification. Network pharmacology, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the effects of glabridin on pigmentation-related targets.
Results
Among the tested extracts, the 80\% ethanol extract of G. glabra ({GGE}80) exhibited the most potent inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase ({TYR}) activity in vitro, along with significantly reduced melanin content and {TYR} activity in B16F10 melanoma cells. {GGE}80 also suppressed melanin accumulation and downregulated the key melanogenesis-associated proteins. Seven major compounds were identified in {GGE}80: liquiritin, isoliquiritin, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, glycyrrhizic acid, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid, and glabridin. Among these, liquiritin, isoliquiritigenin and glabridin were identified as the primary melanin-inhibitory agents. Of these, glabridin demonstrated the most potent, activity in both in vivo and in vitro models. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that glabridin targeted {MITF}, a central transcription factor regulating melanogenic enzymes. Mechanistic studies further indicated that glabridin reduced {CREB} phosphorylation and {SOX}10 protein expression, both critical regulators of {MITF} transcription. Additionally, glabridin inhibited the nuclear translocation of {CRTC}1, a {CREB}-regulated transcription coactivator, leading to its cytoplasmic retention and phosphorylation.
Conclusions
The {GGE}80 demonstrated the most significant whitening effects. Among its constituents, glabridin was identified as the key active compound responsible for inhibiting melanogenesis. Mechanistically, glabridin exerts its effects by suppressing {CREB}/{CRTC}1-mediated transcriptional activation of {MITF}.},

The polyphenol possesses antioxidant properties, which proved effective in the prevention of {UV}-induced skin damage and to alleviate the symptoms of Imiquimod-induced psoriasis. The three endpoints of this review not only showed interesting results but also highlighted some limitations of {EGCG}. Studies show that the molecule is unstable, which may hinder its dermatological and cosmetic applications. The reported interactions with cosmetic ingredients were limited. As the health aspects of {EGCG} are well-reported, {ECGC} has become a focus of interest for health professionals trying to treat common dermatological diseases.},

	abstract = {Dietary flavonoids may protect against sunburn inflammation in skin. Preliminary reports using less complete analysis suggest that certain catechins and their metabolites are found in skin biopsies and blister fluid after consumption of green tea; however, it is not known if they are affected by solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation ({UVR}) or whether conjugated forms, with consequently altered bioactivity, are present. The present study tested the hypothesis that {UVR} affects the catechin levels in the skin of healthy volunteers after consumption of green tea and how catechins in the plasma are related to their presence in skin tissue samples. In an open oral intervention study, 11 subjects consumed green tea and vitamin C supplements daily for 3months. Presupplementation and postsupplementation plasma samples, suction blister fluid and skin biopsies were collected; the latter two samples were collected both before and after {UVR}. A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric assay was used to measure the intact catechin metabolites, conjugates and free forms. Seven green tea catechins and their corresponding metabolites were identified postsupplementation in skin biopsies, 20 in blister fluid and 26 in plasma, with 15 green tea catechin metabolites present in both blister fluid and plasma. The valerolactone, O-methyl-M4-O-sulfate, a gut microbiota metabolite of catechins, was significantly increased 1.6-fold by {UVR} in blister fluid samples. In conclusion, there were some common catechin metabolites in the plasma and blister fluid, and the concentration was always higher in plasma. The results suggest that green tea catechins and metabolites are bioavailable in skin and provide a novel link between catechin metabolites derived from the skin and gut microbiota.},

The green tea constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}) is a potent antioxidant and has shown remarkable preventive effects against photocarcinogenesis and phototoxicity in mouse models. In this study we have investigated the effects of topical application of {EGCG}, the major polyphenol present in green tea, to human skin before {UV} irradiation on {UV}-induced markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymes. Using immunohistochemistry and analytical enzyme assays, we found that application of {EGCG} (mg/cm(2) skin) before a single {UV} exposure of 4x minimal erythema dose ({MED}) markedly decreases {UV}-induced production of hydrogen peroxide (68-90\%, P {\textless} 0.025-0.005) and nitric oxide (30-100\%, P {\textless} 0.025-0.005) in both epidermis and dermis in a time-dependent manner. {EGCG} pretreatment also inhibits {UV}-induced infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes, particularly {CD}11b(+) cells (a surface marker of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils), into the skin, which are considered to be the major producers of reactive oxygen species. {EGCG} treatment was also found to inhibit {UV}-induced epidermal lipid peroxidation at each time point studied (41-84\%, P {\textless} 0.05). A single {UV} exposure of 4x {MED} to human skin was found to increase catalase activity (109-145\%) and decrease glutathione peroxidase ({GPx}) activity (36-54\%) and total glutathione ({GSH}) level (13-36\%) at different time points studied. Pretreatment with {EGCG} was found to restore the {UV}-induced decrease in {GSH} level and afforded protection to the antioxidant enzyme {GPx}. Further studies are warranted to study the preventive effects of {EGCG} against multiple exposures to {UV} light of human skin.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation-induced infiltrating leukocytes, depletion of antigen-presenting cells, and oxidative stress in the skin play an important role in the induction of immune suppression and photocarcinogenesis. Earlier we have shown that topical application of polyphenols from green tea or its major chemopreventive constituent (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}) prevents {UV}-B-induced immunosuppression in mice. To define the mechanism of prevention, we found that topical application of {EGCG} (3 mg/mouse/3 cm(2) of skin area) to C3H/{HeN} mice before a single dose of {UV}-B (90 {mJ}/cm(2)) exposure inhibited {UV}-B-induced infiltration of leukocytes, specifically the {CD}11b+ cell type, and myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of tissue infiltration of leukocytes. {EGCG} treatment was also found to prevent {UV}-B-induced depletion in the number of antigen-presenting cells when immunohistochemically detected as class {II} {MHC}+ Ia+ cells. {UV}-B-induced infiltrating cell production of H2O2 and nitric oxide ({NO}) was determined as a marker of oxidative stress. We found that pretreatment of {EGCG} decreased the number of {UV}-B-induced increases in H2O2-producing cells and inducible nitric oxide synthase-expressing cells and the production of H2O2 and {NO} in both epidermis and dermis at a {UV}-B-irradiated site. Together, these data suggest that prevention of {UV}-B-induced infiltrating leukocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and oxidative stress by {EGCG} treatment of mouse skin may be associated with the prevention of {UV}-B-induced immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis.},

	abstract = {Many modern cosmetic or sunscreen products contain nano-sized components. Nanoemulsions are transparent and have unique tactile and texture properties; nanocapsule, nanosome, noisome, or liposome formulations contain small vesicles (range: 50 to 5000 nm) consisting of traditional cosmetic materials that protect light-or oxygen-sensitive cosmetic ingredients. Transdermal delivery and cosmetic research suggests that vesicle materials may penetrate the stratum corneum ({SC}) of the human skin, but not into living skin. Depending on the physical/chemical properties of the ingredient and the formulation, nano-sized formulations may enhance or reduce skin penetration, albeit at a limited rate. Modern sunscreens contain insoluble titanium dioxide ({TiO}(2)) or zinc oxide ({ZnO}) nanoparticles ({NP}), which are colorless and reflect/scatter ultraviolet ({UV}) more efficiently than larger particles. Most available theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that insoluble {NP} do not penetrate into or through normal as well as compromised human skin. Oral and topical toxicity data suggest that {TiO}(2) and {ZnO} {NP} have low systemic toxicity and are well tolerated on the skin. In vitro cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and photogenotoxicity studies on {TiO}(2) or other insoluble {NP} reporting uptake by cells, oxidative cell damage, or genotoxicity should be interpreted with caution, since such toxicities may be secondary to phagocytosis of mammalian cells exposed to high concentrations of insoluble particles. Caution needs to be exercised concerning topical exposure to other {NP} that either have characteristics enabling some skin penetration and/or have inherently toxic constituents. Studies on wear debris particles from surgical implants and other toxicity studies on insoluble particles support the traditional toxicology view that the hazard of small particles is mainly defined by the intrinsic toxicity of particles, as distinct from their particle size. There is little evidence supporting the principle that smaller particles have greater effects on the skin or other tissues or produce novel toxicities relative to micro-sized materials. Overall, the current weight of evidence suggests that nano-materials such as nano-sized vesicles or {TiO}(2) and {ZnO} nanoparticles currently used in cosmetic preparations or sunscreens pose no risk to human skin or human health, although other {NP} may have properties that warrant safety evaluation on a case-by-case basis before human use.},

	abstract = {α-Bisabolol is one of the important monocyclic sesquiterpenes, derived naturally from essential oils of many edible and ornamental plants. It was first obtained from Matricaria chamomilla, commonly known as chamomile or German chamomile. The available literature indicates that this plant along with other α-Bisabolol containing plants is popularly used in traditional medicine for potential health benefits and general wellbeing. Nutritional studies are indicative of the health benefits of α-Bisabolol. Numerous experimental studies demonstrated pharmacological properties of α-Bisabolol including anticancer, antinociceptive, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and antimicrobial. This review aims to collectively present different pharmacological activities based on both in vitro and in vivo studies. In the present review using synoptic tables and figures, we comprehensively present that α-Bisabolol possesses therapeutic and protective activities, therefore, it can be used for potential health benefits based on pharmacological effects, underlying molecular mechanism, and favorable pharmaceutical properties. Based on the studies mostly performed on cell lines or animal models, it is evident that α-Bisabolol may be a promising nutraceutical and phytomedicine to target aberrant biological mechanisms which result in altered physiological processes and various ailments. Given the polypharmacological effects and pleiotropic properties, along with favorable pharmacokinetics, and dietary availability and safety, α-Bisabolol can be used as a dietary agent, nutraceutical or phytopharmaceutical agent or as an adjuvant with currently available modern medicines. The regulatory approval of this molecule for use as food additives, and in cosmetics and fragrance industry is also supportive of its human usage. Moreover, further studies are necessary to address pharmaceutical, pharmacological, and toxicological aspects before clinical or nutritional usage in humans. The biological actions and health benefits open opportunities for pharmaceutical development with pharmacological basis of its use in future therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Sanitation and hygiene technologies have existed in ancient Hellas since the Bronze Age (ca. 3200–1100 bc), when extensive sewerage and drainage and other elaborate sanitary structures were known in Minoan palaces and towns. Classical and Hellenistic periods should be considered as the most progressive eras in the design of sanitary engineering. At that time anatomically shaped toilet seats are found in several sites since many private houses and public buildings have them. As cities grew in size the pressure of larger populations resulted in the construction of communal toilets with seats that were more densely packed together. Drainage and sewerage systems and sanitary installations reflect high cultural and technological levels and they are associated with contemporary observations and ideas about hygiene and medicine. Before the Hellenic advances, medicine was entirely confined to religious beliefs and metaphysical rituals. In the early Roman period, the knowledge of the ancient world on hygienic matter was incorporated in legislative rules. Despite the weakening of this legislation through the ages, the sanitation practices kept being applied even via a technical tradition of the masons. Later various rulers of the Hellenic world (Europeans or Ottomans), introduced their practices (traditional/scientific) sanitation in the greater Helladic regions.},

Nanoprecipitation, interfacial deposition and spontaneous emulsification methods were used to prepare the nanostructured suspension. The hydrodynamic diameters were 252nm for the nanoemulsion, 277nm for the nanocapsules and 202nm for the nanospheres containing nimesulide. The different nanocarrier systems were incorporated in the hydrophilic gels and their ability of delivering the drug into the human skin were investigated using stripping technique and Franz-type diffusion cells. The amount of nimesulide released into the stratum corneum ({SC}) from the gel containing nanocapsules ({GNM}-{NC}) and the gel containing nanospheres ({GNM}-{NS}) was similar. On the other hand, for the gel containing nanoemulsion ({GNM}-{NE}), the nimesulide was not quantified in {SC}, but it has been directly permeated for the dermis. The penetration of the nimesulide using the gel containing nanocapsules ({GNM}-{NC}) was larger in the deeper skin than using the gel containing nanospheres ({GNM}-{NS}) or the one containing nanoemulsion ({GNM}-{NE}).

	abstract = {Human Langerhans cell ({LC}) precursors populate the epidermis early during prenatal development and thereafter undergo massive proliferation. The prototypic antiproliferative cytokine {TGF}-β1 is required for {LC} differentiation from human {CD}34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and blood monocytes in vitro. Similarly, {TGF}-β1 deficiency results in {LC} loss in vivo. However, immunohistology studies revealed that human {LC} niches in early prenatal epidermis and adult basal (germinal) keratinocyte layers lack detectable {TGF}-β1. Here we demonstrated that these {LC} niches express high levels of bone morphogenetic protein 7 ({BMP}7) and that Bmp7-deficient mice exhibit substantially diminished {LC} numbers, with the remaining cells appearing less dendritic. {BMP}7 induces {LC} differentiation and proliferation by activating the {BMP} type-I receptor {ALK}3 in the absence of canonical {TGF}-β1–{ALK}5 signaling. Conversely, {TGF}-β1–induced in vitro {LC} differentiation is mediated via {ALK}3; however, co-induction of {ALK}5 diminished {TGF}-β1–driven {LC} generation. Therefore, selective {ALK}3 signaling by {BMP}7 promotes high {LC} yields. Within epidermis, {BMP}7 shows an inverse expression pattern relative to {TGF}-β1, the latter induced in suprabasal layers and up-regulated in outer layers. We observed that {TGF}-β1 inhibits microbial activation of {BMP}7-generated {LCs}. Therefore, {TGF}-β1 in suprabasal/outer epidermal layers might inhibit {LC} activation, resulting in {LC} network maintenance.},

In this study are isolated and identified two novel reaction products of {EGCG} and one product of {EGC} when they were reacted separately with H(2)O(2). These products are formed by the oxidation and decarboxylation of the A ring in the catechin molecule.

	abstract = {Synopsis The efficacy of ellagic acid ({EA}), one of the naturally occurring polyphenols, in inhibiting melanogenesis was examined in vitro and in vivo. When mushroom-derived tyrosinase, a metaloprotein containing copper, was incubated with {EA}, enzymatic activity tended to decrease with decreasing copper concentration. Enzyme activity partially recovered when copper was added to the inactivated enzyme. Tyrosinase activity in the B16 melanoma cells was observed to recover in a dose-dependent manner when copper ions were added to the medium containing {EA}. Based on these results, {EA} is thought to react specifically with the copper located at the active centre of the tyrosinase molecule. Furthermore, when {EA} was applied for 6 weeks to brownish guinea-pigs, which have melanocytes in their skin, at the same time as irradiating for 2 weeks with ultra-violet light, skin pigmentation was clearly suppressed and the skin to which {EA} had been applied showed features similar to that of non-irradiated skin. These areas were irradiated again when the application of {EA} had been completed, and skin pigmentation occurred at the former site of {EA} application. In similar studies with hydroquinone, re-pigmentation did not occur on the sites at which hydroquinone (1\%) had been applied. Based on the results reported here, {EA} is thought to suppress melanogenesis by reacting with activated melanocytes and without injuring cells. Résumé Le pouvoir inhibiteur de la melanogenese par l’acide élagique ({AE}), un polyphénol naturel, a étéétudiéin vitro et in vivo. Nous avons fait incuber avec l’{AE} la tyrosinase extraite de champignons. C’est une métallo-protéine contenant du cuivre dont l’activité enzymatique tend à diminuer proportionnellement à la diminution de concentration en cuivre. Mais l’activité enzymatique se restaure partiellement, lorsque du cuivre est ajouté au milieu. Par ailleurs, l’activité de la tyrosinase dans des cellules de mélanome B16 s’exprime de façon dependante des ions cuivre ajoutés au milieu contenant l’{AE}. Sur la base de ces résultats, on peut penser que l’{AE} réagit de manière spécifique vis à vis du cuivre situé au centre actif de la molécule de tyrosinase. De plus, l’{AE} a été appliqué sur la peau de cochons d’Inde bruns durant 6 semaines. Ces animaux possèdent des mélanocytes cutanés, et suite à irradition simultanée aux {UV} pendant 2 semaines, la pigmentation cutanée disparait clairement. La peau sur laquelle on a appliqué l’{AE} montre des caractères similaires à ceux de la peau non-irradiée. Lorsque ces surfaces furent irradiées à leur tour en fin de période d’application, on observa la re-pigmentation de la peau à l’endroit de l’application de l’{AE}. Par des experiénces comparables avec de l’hydroquinone, le phénomène de re-pigmentation aux points d’application d’hydroquinone (en solution a 1\%) n’a pas été observé. A la base de ces résultats, on peut penser que l’{AE} inhibe la mélanogénèse par réaction avec les mélanocytes activés, sans endommager les cellules.},

	abstract = {Interleukin-6 ({IL}-6) is a multifunctional inflammatory cytokine that is produced by monocytes and keratinocytes upon stimulation. Because psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by a hyperproliferative activity of keratinocytes and an inflammatory infiltrate, in the present study {IL}-6 production of monocytes and keratinocytes of patients with psoriasis was investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}) derived from psoriatics, atopics, and healthy controls were incubated for 24 h and, subsequently, supernatant {IL}-6 activity was measured using an {IL}-6-dependent hybridoma cell line (B9). Compared to controls and atopics, {PBMC} of psoriatics produced significantly increased amounts of biologically active {IL}-6. These findings were also confirmed by Western blot analysis using a specific antiserum directed against {IL}-6. Moreover, when the sera of the same patients were tested for {IL}-6 activity, sera of psoriatics contained significantly elevated amounts of circulating {IL}-6 in comparison to samples from atopics and healthy controls. In contrast to normal or uninvolved skin, keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions were remarkably positive for {IL}-6 as detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In addition, {IL}-6 also was found to induce its own synthesis and release by monocytes. These findings indicate that keratinocytes and monocytes in psoriasis are activated to produce increased amounts of {IL}-6, which may be one of the mediators involved in the regulation of both local and systemic inflammatory reactions occurring in skin diseases such as psoriasis.},

	abstract = {Our research has shown that the degree of photosensitivity of the cysteine proteases can be arranged in the following order: bromelain → ficin → papain. After the {UV} irradiation with 151 J·m-2 intensity of a bromelain solution, the enzyme activity has increased. No decrease in the catalytic capacity and the change in the size of the molecule was recorded in the 151-6040 J·m-2 range of irradiation intensities. A decrease in the catalytic capacity of ficin and the increase of its globule size occurred after exposure to a radiation of 3020 J·m-2 intensity. The decrease in papain activity was observed at the {UV} irradiation intensity of 453 J·m-2, and an increase of the papain globule size was detected at 755 J·m-2. Immobilization on chitosan matrix leads to the increase in the stability of heterogeneous biocatalysts with respect to {UV} irradiation in comparison with free enzymes. The changes in {IR} spectra of immobilized cysteine proteases practically do not affect the bands due to the protein component of the system: amide I, amide {II}, amide {III}. Therefore, it can be postulated that the chitosan matrix acts as photoprotector for immobilized ficin, bromelain and papain. The obtained results can be helpful for development of drugs based on chitosan and cysteine proteases in combination with phototherapy, as well as for choosing their sterilization conditions.},

Therefore, this study was designed to investigate anti-inflammatory effects of (-)-α-bisabolol and its mechanisms of action. In this study, we found that (-)-α-bisabolol inhibited lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-induced production of nitric oxide ({NO}) and prostaglandin E(2) ({PGE}(2)) in {RAW}264.7 cells. In addition, expression of cyclooxygenase-2 ({COX}-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase ({iNOS}) genes was reduced, as evidenced by Western blot and luciferase reporter assays for {COX}-2 and {iNOS}. To assess the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory property of (-)-α-bisabolol, its effects on the activity of {AP}-1 and {NF}-κB promoters were examined. {LPS}-induced activation of {AP}-1 and {NF}-κB promoters was significantly reduced by (-)-α-bisabolol.

In addition, while {LPS}-induced phosphorylation of {ERK} and p38 was attenuated by (-)-α-bisabolol, significant changes in the level of phosphorylated {JNK} were not observed.

Overproduction of melanin could lead to a variety of skin disorders. Glabridin, an isoflavan, isolated from the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn, has exhibited several pharmacological activities, including excellent inhibitory effects on tyrosinase. In this paper, the inhibitory kinetics of glabridin on tyrosinase and their binding mechanisms were determined using spectroscopic, zebrafish model and molecular docking techniques. The results indicate that glabridin reversibly inhibits tyrosinase in a noncompetitive manner through a multiphase kinetic process with the {IC}50 of 0.43μmol/L. It has been shown that glabridin had a strong ability to quench the intrinsic fluorescence of tyrosinase mainly through a static quenching procedure, suggesting a stable glabridin-tyrosinase complex may be generated. The results of molecular docking suggest that glabridin did not directly bind to the active site of tyrosinase. Moreover, according to the results of zebrafish model system, glabridin shows no effects on melanin synthesis in zebrafish but presents toxicity to zebrafish embryo. The possible inhibitory mechanisms, which will help to design and search for tyrosinase inhibitors especially for glabridin analogues, were proposed.},

Yet the potential ability of {NPs} to penetrate into the underlying viable tissue lies at the center of debate. This review briefly highlights the current applications of inorganic {NPs}, then discusses the current status of their skin penetration in view of the vast variation among the experimental setups in use. Determinants of particle penetration, adopted approaches for enhanced penetration, the underlying mechanism, as well as qualitative and quantitative analysis of {NPs} present in the skin are also within the scope of this review article. We emphasize analyzing the data generated from experiments on human skin, the “gold standard” for assessment of in vitro skin penetration.

	volume = {32},
	doi = {10.1111/jdv.15026},
	shorttitle = {Katharsis of the skin},
	abstract = {Background
Recipes for peelings date back to medical texts of old Egypt. The oldest medical papyri contain recipes for “improving beauty of the skin” and “removing wrinkles” by use of agents like salt and soda. The Egyptian Queen Cleopatra (69–30 {BC}) is said to have taken bathes in donkey's milk in order to improve the beauty of her skin. However, little is known about other agents and peeling applications in later Greek medical textbooks.

Objective
We will discover new agents and describe ancient peeling applications. First, we will have to identify ancient Greek medical terms for the modern terms “peeling” and “chemical peeling”. Second, based on the identified terms we will perform a systematic fulltext search for agents in original sources. Third, we will categorize the results into three peeling applications: (1) cleansing, (2) aesthetical improvement of the skin, and (3) therapy of dermatological diseases.

Methods
We performed a full systematic keyword search with the identified Greek terms in databases of ancient Greek texts. Our keywords for peeling and chemical peeling are “smēxis” and “trīpsis”. Our keywords for agents of peeling and chemical peeling are “smégmata”, “rhýmmata”, “kathartiká”, and “trímmata”.

Results
Diocles (4th century {BC}) was the first one who mentioned “smēxis” and “trīpsis” as parts of daily cleansing routine. Criton (2nd century {AD}) wrote about peeling applications, but any reference to the agents is lost. Antyllos (2nd century {AD}) composed three lists of peeling applications including agents.

Conclusion
Greek medical textbooks of Graeco‐Roman antiquity report several peeling applications like cleansing, brightening, darkening, softening, and aesthetical improvement of the skin by use of peeling and chemical peeling, as well as therapy of dermatological diseases. There are 27 ancient agents for what is contemporarily called peeling and chemical peeling. We discovered more specific agents than hitherto known to research.

In general, the oil–water interface is the location of initiation of oxidation reactions, while components present there, and in the continuous phase, directly or indirectly affect the reaction. Smaller droplets are expected to oxidize faster, but this can be counteracted by components purposely positioned at the interface or added to the bulk phase. Recent simulation progress is expected to be instrumental in distinguishing these effects, and guides stable emulsion design.},

	abstract = {Epigallocatechin gallate ({EGCG}) was structurally modified for enhanced lipophilicity and hence expanded applications, as well as improved cellular absorption in vivo. Ester derivatives of {EGCG} with stearic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were prepared. All {EGCG} derivatives inhibited oxidation of bulk oil, and their potency was superior or similar to that of the parent {EGCG} molecule. The derivatives were more efficient than {EGCG} in inhibiting oxidation in a β-carotene/linoleic acid emulsion and pork model systems, and their efficiency correlated well with their lipophilicity. In biological systems, the ester derivatives showed higher cell membrane affinity and therefore better cellular absorption than {EGCG}. The derivatives were more effective than {EGCG} against Cu2+-induced {LDL}-cholesterol oxidation and also effectively inhibited hydroxyl and peroxyl radical-induced {DNA} scission and {UV}-induced liposome oxidation. These results suggest that {EGCG} esters may be used in food as lipophilic alternatives to {EGCG}, without compromising functional and physiological properties. Moreover, {EGCG}–polyunsaturated fatty acid esters may render additional advantages to human health.},

Thus, we combined in silico and experimental methods to study the ability of neutral and anionic vesicles to encapsulate {EGCG} in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ divalent salts. Experimental and in silico results show a very high correlation, thus confirming the efficiency of the developed methodology. In particular, we found out that the presence of calcium ions hinders the insertion of {EGCG} in the liposome bilayer in both neutral and anionic systems. On the contrary, the presence of {MgCl}2 improves the insertion degree of {EGCG} molecules respect to the liposomes without divalent salts. The best and most efficient salt concentration is that corresponding to a 5:1 molar ratio between Mg2+ and {EGCG}, in both neutral and anionic vesicles. Concerning the lipid matrix composition, the anionic one results in better promotion of the catechin insertion within the bilayer since experimentally we achieved 100\% {EGCG} encapsulation in the lipid carrier in the presence of a 5:1 molar ratio of magnesium. Thus, the combination of this anionic liposomal formulation with magnesium chloride, avoids time-consuming separation steps of unentrapped active principle and appears particularly suitable for {EGCG} delivery applications.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: This research was designed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory impacts of liquiritin on lipopolysaccharide ({LPS})-activated human corneal epithelial cells ({HCECs}).
{METHODS}: The Cell Counting kit-8 ({CCK}-8) assay was adopted to assess cell viability. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ({ELISA}) was used to detect the secretion levels of the proinflammatory cytokines {IL}-6, {IL}-8, and {TNF}-α. Transcriptome analysis was conducted to identify the genes that exhibited differential expression between different treatment. The model group included cells treated with {LPS} (10 µg/{mL}), the treatment group comprised cells treated with liquiritin (80 µM) and {LPS} (10 µg/{mL}), and the control group consisted of untreated cells. To further validate the expression levels of the selected genes, including {CSF}2, {CXCL}1, {CXCL}2, {CXCL}8, {IL}1A, {IL}1B, {IL}24, {IL}6, and {LTB}, quantitative real-time {PCR} was performed. The expression of proteins related to the Akt/{NF}-κB signaling pathway was assessed through western blot analysis. {NF}-κB nuclear translocation was evaluated through immunofluorescence staining.
{RESULTS}: The secretion of {IL}-6, {IL}-8, and {TNF}-α in {LPS}-induced {HCECs} was significantly downregulated by liquiritin. Based on the transcriptome analysis, the {mRNA} expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {IL}-1β, {IL}-24, {TNF}-α, and {IL}-1α was overproduced by {LPS} stimulation, and suppressed after liquiritin treatment. Furthermore, the Western blot results revealed a remarkable reduction in the phosphorylation degrees of {NF}-κB p65, {IκB}, and Akt upon treatment with liquiritin. Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis confirmed liquiritin's inhibition of {LPS}-induced p65 nuclear translocation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Collectively, these findings imply that liquiritin suppresses the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and the anti-inflammatory impacts of liquiritin may be caused by its repression of the Akt/{NF}-κB signaling pathway in {LPS}-induced {HCECs}. These data indicate that liquiritin could provide a potential therapeutic application for inflammation-associated corneal diseases.},

Among them, solar dermatitis is one of the important risk factors for malignant melanoma, so prevention and treatment of solar dermatitis is very necessary. Additionally, liquiritin ({LQ}) has anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and pro-wound healing effects of liquiritin carbomer gel cold paste ({LQ}-{CG}-{CP}) in vitro and in vivo. The results of {MTT} experiments showed no cytotoxicity of {LQ} at concentrations of 40 μg/{mL} and below and cell damage at {UVB} irradiation doses above 60 {mJ}/cm2. Moreover, {LQ} can promote cell migration. {ELISA} results also showed that {LQ} inhibited the elevation of the inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor-α ({TNF}-α), interleukin-1β ({IL}-1β), and interleukin-6 ({IL}-6) after {UVB} irradiation. In the mouse model of solar dermatitis, 2\% {LQ}-{CG}-{CP} showed the best therapeutic efficacy for wound healing and relief of itching compared to {MEIBAO} moist burn moisturizer ({MEBO}). What is more, the results of skin histopathological examination show that {LQ}-{CG}-{CP} promotes re-epithelialization, shrinks wounds, and promotes collagen production, thus promoting wound healing. Simultaneously, {LQ}-{CG}-{CP} reduced {TNF}-α, {IL}-1β, and {IL}-6 expression. In addition, {LQ}-{CG}-{CP} was not observed to cause histopathological changes and blood biochemical abnormalities in mice.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Psoriasis ({PSO}) poses a global health threat. The current research challenge in {PSO} is relapse. Liquiritin ({LIQ}), a major active compound from Glycyrrhiza inflata Batalin, has multiple pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms underlying {LIQ}'s therapeutic actions in {PSO} and prevention abilities remain elusive.
{PURPOSE}: The present study aimed to delve into the potential to treat and prevent {PSO} and the mechanism of {LIQ}.
{METHODS}: The anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects of {LIQ} were studied in vitro with the {HaCaT} cell line. Then, Transcriptional analysis and bioinformatic analysis were used to determine the internal associations of the target set. Subsequently, functional experiment, luciferase report assay, {ChIP}-{PCR}, and immunohistochemical validation of clinical samples were performed to investigate the mechanism of {LIQ}. Finally, the anti-psoriatic effects and prevention abilities of {LIQ} were verified in vivo with imiquimod ({IMQ})-induced {PSO}-like mouse models.
{RESULTS}: Here, we identified differentially expressed genes in {LIQ}-stimulated {HaCaT} cells and Retinol-Binding Protein 3 ({RBP}3) as the core target, whereas {YY}1 was a predicted upstream transcription factor of {RBP}3. The {YY}1/{RBP}3 axis was obviously altered after administering {LIQ} at optimal doses of 20 μM in vitro and 100 µg/ml in vivo. {LIQ} can significantly inhibit the progression of {PSO} in vivo. Notably, {LIQ} also prevented the relapse of psoriatic lesions induced by the second round of low-dose {IMQ}. Mechanistically, we observed that {LIQ} could increase the promotion of {YY}1 for {RBP}3 by enhancing the binding affinity between them.
{CONCLUSION}: These findings revealed that the {YY}1/{RBP}3 axis is a potential psoriatic target, and {LIQ} is a promising and innovative therapeutic candidate for the treatment and prevention of {PSO}.},

	abstract = {In the last years, consumers are paying much more attention to natural medicines and principles, mainly due to the general sense that natural compounds are safe. On the other hand, there is a growing demand by industry for plants used in traditional medicine that could be incorporated in foods, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, or even pharmaceuticals. Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn. belongs to the Fabaceae family and has been recognized since ancient times for its ethnopharmacological values. This plant contains different phytocompounds, such as glycyrrhizin, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid, glabrin A and B, and isoflavones, that have demonstrated various pharmacological activities. Pharmacological experiments have demonstrated that different extracts and pure compounds from this species exhibit a broad range of biological properties, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities. A few toxicological studies have reported some concerns. This review addresses all those issues and focuses on the pharmacological activities reported for G. glabra. Therefore, an updated, critical, and extensive overview on the current knowledge of G. glabra composition and biological activities is provided here in order to explore its therapeutic potential and future challenges to be utilized for the formulation of new products that will contribute to human well-being.},

{OBJECTIVE}: Our purpose was to investigate alterations in the production and morphology of collagen fibers brought about by long-term sun exposure.
{METHODS}: We compared collagen and collagenase gene expression and collagen immunohistochemical staining and used confocal laser scanning microscopy for morphologic examination of dermal collagen fibers in photodamaged compared with sun-protected skin from the same persons.
{RESULTS}: Despite a large increase in elastin messenger {RNA} in sun-damaged skin, collagen and collagenase gene expression remained essentially unchanged. However, striking alterations in the papillary dermis of photoaged skin were found, which revealed large, abnormally clumped elastic fibers and deformed collagen fibers of various diameters, replacing the normal architecture of the papillary dermis.
{CONCLUSION}: Our data provide evidence for normal collagen gene expression in sun-damaged skin and suggest that degradation and remodeling of collagen take place in the papillary dermis accompanied by deposition of other matrix components, predominantly abnormal elastic fibers.},

This barrier function is mainly provided by the outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis. The epidermis is maintained by epidermal stem cells which reside in the basal layer and which generate daughter cells that move upwards towards the surface of the skin. During this journey, keratinocytes undergo a series of biochemical and morphological changes that result in the formation of the various layers of the epidermis. Eventually, these cells turn into the outermost layer of dead cornified cells that are sloughed into the environment. This review summarizes our current understanding of the mechanisms that control proliferation and differentiation of epidermal stem cells, and thus addresses fundamental processes that control epidermal morphogenesis and function.},

The liquorice extract showed significant activity in all the three assay systems used in a dose dependent manner. It displayed remarkable reactivity with free stable 1,1'-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl ({DPPH}) radical, inhibitory efficacy in peroxidatively damaged unilamellar dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine ({DOPC}) liposomes, and inhibition of {ROS} chemiluminescence, generated by whole blood, induced by both receptor-bypassing stimuli ({PMA}) and receptor operating stimuli (Opz) in the ranking order of stimuli {PMA}{\textgreater} Opz. These activities may be attributed to phenolic antioxidants involving isoflavan derivatives, coumarins and chalcones. Nonetheless, triterpene saponin glycyrrhizin exhibited no efficacy in the system of {DPPH} reaction and peroxidation of liposomal membrane, and negligible inhibition of chemiluminescence generated by inflammatory cells. These results indicate that the mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect of glycyrrhizin most probably does not involve {ROS} and this major constituent is not responsible for the inhibition effects of liquorice extract on neutrophil functions.},

This review aims to present recent trends in the development of metabolomics tools and their potential to address new issues in natural cosmetics for more effective selection and control of natural ingredients. The current sources of natural ingredients used in skincare products are summarized. The actual metabolomics approaches are delineated, encompassing the pivotal steps of metabolomic workflow from sample extraction and metabolite identification to data mining and statistical analysis. Outlined are diverse cosmeceutical activities, ranging from antioxidant effectiveness and anti-inflammatory potential to rejuvenating properties, ultraviolet radiation protection, and the brightening attributes inherent in natural extracts. Finally, we presented the contributions of metabolomics to the quality assessment of natural cosmetics ingredients by identification of bioactive compounds, dereplication of bio-sourced ingredients, quality and safety assessment of extracts, authentication, and traceability, and the detection of adulteration. This review presents systematic approaches to studying the complex phytochemical mixtures found in natural ingredients, linking analytical techniques to biological assay systems, and thereby opening new opportunities for discovering active principles and assisting in the production of standardized compositions.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to develop microemulsions ({MEs}) containing α-bisabolol for the topical treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis ({CL}). Initially, pseudoternary phase diagrams were developed using α-bisabolol as the oil phase, Eumulgin® {CO} 40 as the surfactant, Polymol® {HE} as the co-surfactant, and distilled water as the aqueous phase. Two transparent liquid systems ({TLS}) containing 5\% of α-bisabolol were selected and characterized (F5E25 and F5EP25). Next, skin permeation and retention assays were performed using Franz cells. The interaction of the formulation with the stratum corneum ({SC}) was evaluated using the {FTIR} technique. The cytotoxicity was evaluated in murine peritoneal macrophages. Finally, the antileishmanial activity of microemulsions was determined in promastigotes and amastigotes of L. amazonensis (strain {MHOM}/{BR}/77/{LTB} 0016). As a result, the selected formulations showed isotropy, nanometric size (below 25 nm), Newtonian behavior and {pH} ranging from 6.5 to 6.9. The {MEs} achieved a 2.5-fold increase in the flux and skin-permeated amount of α-bisabolol. {ATR}-{FTIR} results showed that microemulsions promoted fluidization and extraction of lipids and proteins of the stratum corneum, increasing the diffusion coefficient and partition coefficient of the drug in the skin. Additionally, F5E25 and F5EP25 showed higher activity against promastigotes ({IC}50 13.27 and 18.29, respectively) compared to unencapsulated α-bisabolol ({IC}50 53.8). Furthermore, F5E25 and F5EP25 also showed antileishmanial activity against intracellular amastigotes of L. amazonensis, with {IC}50 50 times lower than free α-bisabolol and high selectivity index (up to 15). Therefore, the systems obtained are favorable to topical administration, with significant antileishmanial activity against L. amazonensis promastigotes and amastigotes, being a promising system for future in vivo trials.},

Traditionally, the plant is used to cure wounds, pain, ulcers, liver disease, heart disease, cancer, and inflammation. This review aims to compile an analysis of worldwide research, pharmacological activities, phytochemical, toxicological, and ethnomedicinal updates of Moringa oleifera and also provide insight into its commercial and phytopharmaceutical applications with a motive to help further research. The scientific information on this plant was obtained from various sites and search engines such as Scopus, Pub Med, Science Direct, {BMC}, Google Scholar, and other scientific databases. Articles available in the English language have only been referred for review. The pharmacological studies confirm the hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-inflammatory potential of the extracts from the various plant parts. It was found that bioactive constituents are present in every part of the plant. So far, more than one hundred compounds from different parts of Moringa oleifera have been characterized, including alkaloids, flavonoids, anthraquinones, vitamins, glycosides, and terpenes. In addition, novel isolates such as muramoside A\&B and niazimin A\&B have been identified in the plant and have potent antioxidant, anticancer, antihypertensive, hepatoprotective, and nutritional effects. The traditional and nontraditional use of Moringa, its pharmacological effects and their phytopharmaceutical formulations, clinical studies, toxicity profile, and various other uses are recognized in the present review. However, several traditional uses have yet to be scientifically explored. Therefore, further studies are proposed to explore the mechanistic approach of the plant to identify and isolate active or synergistic compounds behind its therapeutic potential.},

These types of products are effective, inexpensive and bio-sustainable, and thus represent a valid alternative to the regular plant derived extracts, more commonly adopted in cosmetic formulations. Moreover, if the waste products come from organic farming, they are certainly an even more valuable source of safe extracts for Cosmetics, since they lack any residual pesticide or potentially toxic chemical.},

Licorice yield, leaf and root nutrient content, and its bioactive compounds were assessed. Mycorrhiza inoculation resulted in the highest rhizome dry weight in the Lalehzar (101.3 g) and Kermanshah (395.6 g) ecotypes in the first and second years, respectively. Rhizome dry weight was higher than the roots in both ecotypes. Two years old Kermanshah ecotype exhibited the highest root dry weight by using urea. The harvest index increased in Lalehzar ecotype by application of vermicompost in the first year and cow manure coupled with plant growth-promoting bacteria ({PGPB}) in the second year. Nitrogen content in leaves and roots significantly increased in the Kermanshah ecotype using cow manure and {PGPB}. Application of mycorrhiza (in Lalehzar ecotype) and cow manure combined with urea (in Kermanshah ecotype) led to leaf phosphorus (P) content improvement. The highest root P content in Lalehzar and Kermanshah ecotypes achieved by using cow manure and urea, respectively. Fertilization by urea and mycorrhiza led to higher leaf potassium (K) content in Kermanshah and Lalehzar, respectively, while urea yielded the highest root K content in the Kermanshah ecotype. Root glycyrrhizic acid ({GA}) content peaked in the Kermanshah ecotype with cow manure and {PGPB} (138 and 372.8 mg g-1 {DW} in the first and second years, respectively). Rhizome {GA} content performed better in the Lalehzar ecotype using cow manure and {PGPB} (191.34 mg g-1 {DW}, first year) and in the Kermanshah ecotype with cow manure and urea (239.62 mg g-1 {DW}, second year). Fertilizers had not significant effect on glabridin ({GL}) content. Notably, {GA} and {GL} exhibited a negative correlation with potassium and nitrogen.

Widespread in the plant kingdom, anthocyanins are the subject of a large number of studies related mainly to their instability in the conditions in which they are used, along with the beneficial effect of their consumption on diseases caused by the accumulation of free radicals. Literature. These aspects are particularly important since anthocyanins are extracted from fruits and vegetables for their use as natural food colorants. This literature review will focus on properties that might be damaged during extraction and purification of anthocyanins. The procedures for the extraction of anthocyanins were reviewed in order to identify opportunities for the use of plant materials in which these molecules are present in large amounts. Conclusions. The color and stability of anthocyanin extracts from fruits and vegetables are strongly influenced by their composition. However, recent improvements in food colorant formulation methods offer new opportunities for the exploitation of vegetables with a high anthocyanin content.},

To aid with risk management of environmental chemicals, the {US} {EPA} utilizes mathematical models to estimate percutaneous penetration when experimental data is not available. Here, the accuracy of predicted flux by the Potts and Guy model based on in vitro penetration is compared to human in vivo data of percutaneous absorption of various organic compounds. For most chemicals, the flux was over- or underestimated by a factor 10–100. In vitro flux was significantly correlated to experimental human in vivo flux; however, the physiochemical parameters used in the Potts and Guy equation, Kp, Koctanol, and molecular weight, did not correlate significantly with in vivo flux. We discuss possible explanations for why the computer model did not accurately predict in vivo flux. Further research is needed with different types of chemicals encountered in the environment, and/or as used in clinical practice.

However, mechanistic insights as to how {SQ} is oxidized by different oxidation mechanisms have been limited, and thus effective measures towards the prevention of {SQ} oxidation have not been identified. In this study, we oxidized {SQ} by either singlet oxygen oxidation or free radical oxidation, and monitored the formation of the six {SQ} monohydroperoxide ({SQOOH}) isomers, the primary oxidation products of {SQ}, at the isomeric level. While singlet oxygen oxidation of {SQ} resulted in the formation of similar amounts of the six {SQOOH} isomers, free radical oxidation of {SQ} mainly formed two types of isomers, 2-{OOH}-{SQ} and 3-{OOH}-{SQ}. The addition of β-carotene during singlet oxygen oxidation, and the addition of α-tocopherol during free radical oxidation lead to a dose-dependent decrease in the formation of {SQOOH} isomers. Such results suggest that the analysis of {SQOOH} at the isomeric level allows for the determination of the cause of {SQ} oxidation in various samples, and provides a foothold for future studies concerning the prevention of {SQ} oxidation.},

Although the results are quite different in dermis and epidermis, extrinsic aging is driven to a large extent by oxidative stress caused by {UV} irradiation. In this review the overall effects of oxidative stress are discussed as well as the sources of {ROS} including the mitochondrial {ETC}, peroxisomal and {ER} localized proteins, the Fenton reaction, and such enzymes as cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, xanthine oxidases, and {NADPH} oxidases. Furthermore, the defense mechanisms against oxidative stress ranging from enzymes like superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxiredoxins, and {GSH} peroxidases to organic compounds such as L-ascorbate, α-tocopherol, beta-carotene, uric acid, {CoQ}10, and glutathione are described in more detail. In addition the oxidative stress induced modifications caused to proteins, lipids and {DNA} are discussed. Finally age-related changes of the skin are also a topic of this review. They include a disruption of the epidermal calcium gradient in old skin with an accompanying change in the composition of the cornified envelope. This modified cornified envelope also leads to an altered anti-oxidative capacity and a reduced barrier function of the epidermis.},

As shown in Figure 14.2, the formation of mesodermal and endodermal organs is not subsequent to neural tube formation, but occurs synchronously. The notochord extends beneath the neural tube from the base of the head into the tail. On either side of the neural tube lie thick bands of mesodermal cells. These bands of paraxial mesoderm are referred to as the segmental plate (in birds) and the unsegmented mesoderm (in mammals). As the primitive streak regresses and the neural folds begin to gather at the center of the embryo, the paraxial mesoderm separates into blocks of cells called somites. Although somites are transient structures, they are extremely important in organizing the segmental pattern of vertebrate embryos. As we saw in the preceding chapter, the somites determine the migration paths of neural crest cells and spinal nerve axons. Somites give rise to the cells that form the vertebrae and ribs, the dermis of the dorsal skin, the skeletal muscles of the back, and the skeletal muscles of the body wall and limbs.Figure 14.2Gastrulation and neurulation in the chick embryo, focusing on the mesodermal component.

	abstract = {Purpose: Green tea and green tea polyphenols have been shown to possess cancer preventive activities in preclinical model systems. In preparation for future green tea intervention trials, we have conducted a clinical study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of green tea polyphenols after 4 weeks of daily p.o. administration of epigallocatechin gallate ({EGCG}) or Polyphenon E (a defined, decaffeinated green tea polyphenol mixture). In an exploratory fashion, we have also determined the effect of chronic green tea polyphenol administration on {UV}-induced erythema response.Experimental Design: Healthy participants with Fitzpatric skin type {II} or {III} underwent a 2-week run-in period and were randomly assigned to receive one of the five treatments for 4 weeks: 800 mg {EGCG} once/day, 400 mg {EGCG} twice/day, 800 mg {EGCG} as Polyphenon E once/day, 400 mg {EGCG} as Polyphenon E twice/day, or a placebo once/day (8 subjects/group). Samples were collected and measurements performed before and after the 4-week treatment period for determination of safety, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity of green tea polyphenol treatment.Results: Adverse events reported during the 4-week treatment period include excess gas, upset stomach, nausea, heartburn, stomach ache, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, and muscle pain. All of the reported events were rated as mild events. For most events, the incidence reported in the polyphenol-treated groups was not more than that reported in the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in blood counts and blood chemistry profiles after repeated administration of green tea polyphenol products. There was a \&gt;60\% increase in the area under the plasma {EGCG} concentration-time curve after 4 weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at a dosing schedule of 800 mg once daily. No significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of {EGCG} after repeated green tea polyphenol treatment at a regimen of 400 mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetics of the conjugated metabolites of epigallocatechin and epicatechin were not affected by repeated green tea polyphenol treatment. Four weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at the selected dose and dosing schedule did not provide protection against {UV}-induced erythema.Conclusions: We conclude that it is safe for healthy individuals to take green tea polyphenol products in amounts equivalent to the {EGCG} content in 8–16 cups of green tea once a day or in divided doses twice a day for 4 weeks. There is a \&gt;60\% increase in the systemic availability of free {EGCG} after chronic green tea polyphenol administration at a high daily bolus dose (800 mg {EGCG} or Polyphenon E once daily).},

	abstract = {Alpha-bisabolol (α-bisabolol), an unsaturated monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol, is known as one of the “most-used herbal constituents” in the world. Various therapeutic and biological properties of α-bisabolol in preventing oxidative stress, inflammatory disorders, infections, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and metabolic disorders have been reported. In this review, we evaluated new findings regarding the molecular mechanisms of α-bisabolol published from 2010 until 2021 in {PubMed}, Science Direct, and Scopus. The antioxidant mechanism of α-bisabolol is mainly associated with the reduction of {ROS}/{RNS}, {MDA}, and {GSH} depletion, {MPO} activity, and augmentation of {SOD} and {CAT}. Additionally, upregulating the expression of bcl-2 and suppression of bax, P53, {APAF}-1, caspase-3, and caspase-9 activity indicates the anti-apoptotic effects of α- bisabolol. It possesses anti-inflammatory effects via reduction of {TNF}-α, {IL}-1β, {IL}-6, {iNOS}, and {COX}-2 and suppresses the activation of {ERK}1/2, {JNK}, {NF}-κB, and p38. The antimicrobial effect is mediated by inhibiting the viability of infected cells and improves cognitive function via downregulation of bax, cleaved caspases-3 and 9 levels, β-secretase, cholinesterase activities, and upregulation of bcl-2 levels. Finally, due to multiple biological activities, α-bisabolol is worthy to be subjected to clinical trials to achieve new insights into its beneficial effects on human health.},

Research on this medicinal plant has been aimed at validating traditional uses and deepening the mechanism of action, identifying the compounds responsible for these activities. The most investigated active compounds are aloe-emodin, aloin, aloesin, emodin, and acemannan. Likewise, new actions have been investigated for Aloe vera and its active compounds. This review provides an overview of current pharmacological studies (in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials), written in English during the last six years (2014-2019). In particular, new pharmacological data research has shown that most studies refer to anti-cancer action, skin and digestive protective activity, and antimicrobial properties. Most recent works are in vitro and in vivo. Clinical trials have been conducted just with Aloe vera, but not with isolated compounds; therefore, it would be interesting to study the clinical effect of relevant metabolites in different human conditions and pathologies. The promising results of these studies in basic research encourage a greater number of clinical trials to test the clinical application of Aloe vera and its main compounds, particularly on bone protection, cancer, and diabetes.},

	abstract = {Phenylethyl resorcinol ({PER}, 4-(1-phenylethyl)1,3-benzenediol) is a very potent tyrosinase inhibitor with clinically proven effectiveness at already 0.5\%. A major challenge of incorporating {PER} into dermal products is its high sensitivity against light. Previously, by incorporating {PER} in nanostructured lipid carriers ({NLC}), chemical stability and tyrosinase activity could be increased by 29\% and 67\%, respectively. Despite this, degradation still occurred accompanied with reddish discoloration of the formulation – not acceptable for market products. In this study {PER} was incorporated into {smartLipids}, the 3rd generation of lipid carriers. Compared to {NLC}, the {smartLipids} formulation had a higher {PER} loading, was {PEG}-free and used {ECOCERT}-certified Lanette N. For {PER} stabilization, 14 additives from three groups were investigated: {UV} blockers, antioxidants and chelating agents. The {UV} blockers Tinosorb S and Oxynex {ST} liquid, as well as the chelating agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and phytic acid completely prevented reddish discoloration under test conditions (3 months in the dark and 7 days at light exposure). Investigating the stabilizing mechanisms, {UV} absorbers with high absorption in {UV}-A range were most effective (Tinosorb S, Oxynex liquid). They showed good stabilization in dark and at light exposure. Chelating agents had mainly an effect via {pH} shift to {pH} 2, thus are not suitable for dermal products requiring {pH} around 5. Antioxidants were less effective. The antioxidants propyl gallate and {BHT} showed best stabilization at storage in dark and slightly less at light exposure, not impairing the physical stability. Some antioxidants even accelerated discoloration (e.g. Tinogard {TT}). In general, low standard electrode potential ({\textless}0.4 {mV}) seems to be favorable for {PER} stabilization. In conclusion, Tinosorb S proved to be the best stabilizer; combination with an antioxidant is optional. By combination of {smartPearls} technology and the Tinosorb S stabilization, {PER} market products without discoloration are feasible.},

	abstract = {Vitamin A (retinol), an essential human nutrient, plays an important role in cellular differentiation, regulation of epidermal cell growth and normal cell maintenance. In addition to these physiological roles, vitamin A has a rich photochemistry. Photoisomerization of vitamin A, involved in signal transduction for vision, has been extensively investigated. The biological effects of light-induced degradation of vitamin A and formation of reactive species are less understood and may be important for light-exposed tissues, such as the skin. Photochemical studies have demonstrated that excitation of retinol or its esters with {UV} light generates a number of reactive species including singlet oxygen and superoxide radical anion. These reactive oxygen species have been shown to damage a number of cellular targets, including lipids and {DNA}. Consistent with the potential for damaging {DNA}, retinyl palmitate has been shown to be photomutagenic in an in vitro test system. The results of mechanistic studies were consistent with mutagenesis through oxidative damage. Vitamin A in the skin resides in a complex environment that in many ways is very different from the chemical environment in solution and in in vitro test systems. Relevant clinical studies or studies in animal models are therefore needed to establish whether the pro-oxidant activity of photoexcited vitamin A is observed in vivo, and to assess the related risks.},

	abstract = {Avobenzone is one of the most common {UVA}-filters in sunscreens, and is known to be photounstable. Some of the strategies used to stabilize this filter present some drawbacks like photosensitization reactions. Antioxidants are widely used as cosmetic ingredients that prevent photoageing and complement the photoprotection offered by the {UV}-filters preventing or reducing photogenerated reactive species. The purpose of this work was to study the effect of antioxidants in the photostabilization of avobenzone. The filter dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and incorporated in a sunscreen formulation was irradiated with simulated solar radiation (750 W/m2). The tested antioxidants were vitamin C, vitamin E, and ubiquinone The area under the curve of the absorption spectrum for {UVA} range and the sun protection factor ({SPF}) were calculated. Vitamin E (1:2), vitamin C (1:0.5) and ubiquinone (1:0.5) were the more effective concentrations increasing the photostability of avobenzone. In sunscreen formulations, the most effective photostabilizer was ubiquinone which also promoted an increase in {SPF}. This knowledge is important to improve effectiveness of sunscreen formulation. Antioxidants can be valuable ingredients for sunscreens with a triple activity of filter stabilization, {SPF} boosting and photoageing prevention.},

The photodecomposition products were separated by reversed-phase {HPLC} and characterized spectroscopically by comparison with authentic standards. The identified products include: 4-keto-{RP}, 11-ethoxy-12-hydroxy-{RP}, 13-ethoxy-14-hydroxy-{RP}, anhydroretinol ({AR}), and trans- and cis-15-ethoxy-{AR}. Photoirradiation of {RP} in the presence of a lipid, methyl linoleate, resulted in induction of lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation was inhibited when sodium azide was present during photoirradiation which suggests free radicals were formed. Our results demonstrate that, similar to irradiation with {UVA} light, {RP} can act as a photosensitizer leading to free radical formation and induction of lipid peroxidation following irradiation with {UVB} light.},

	abstract = {Glabridin, a prenylated isoflavonoid of G. glabra L. roots (European licorice, Fabaceae), has been associated with a wide range of biological properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, regulation of energy metabolism, estrogenic, neuroprotective, anti-osteoporotic, and skin-whitening. While glabridin is one of the most studied licorice flavonoids, a comprehensive literature survey linked to its numerous bioactivities is unavailable. The present review provides a comprehensive description of glabridin as a key chemical and biological marker of G. glabra, by covering both its phytochemical characterization and reported biological activities. Both glabridin and standardized licorice extracts have significant impact on food, dietary supplements ({DSs}) and cosmetic markets, as evidenced by the amount of available patents and scientific articles since 1976, when glabridin was first described. Nevertheless, a thorough literature survey also reveals that information about the isolation and chemical characterization of this important marker is scattered and less detailed than expected. Accordingly, the first part of this review gathers and provides all analytical and spectroscopic data required for the comprehensive phytochemical characterization of glabridin. The four most frequently described and most relevant bioactivities of glabridin are its anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, estrogenic-like effects, and its capacity to regulate energy metabolism. While all bioactivities reported for glabridin belong to a wide array of targets, its principal biological properties are likely interconnected. To this end, the current state of the literature suggests that the biological activity of glabridin mainly results from its capacity to down-regulate intracellular reactive oxygen species, bind to antioxidant effectors, and act on estrogen receptors, potentially as a plant-based Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator ({phytoSERM}).},

This study aims to define the term "phytocosmetics" on the basis of official regulatory sources, assess the state of the literature on phytocosmetics, present examples of natural active ingredients and highlight the advantages and limitations of their use in cosmetics. The literature search was conducted in {PubMed}, Google Scholar and Science Direct, and revealed a relatively small number of articles on phytocosmetics despite the long-standing traditional use of plant ingredients. Although there is no official definition of phytocosmetic products, the term can be understood as cosmetic products containing components of plant origin. Examples of natural active ingredients with various benefits for the skin and hair were presented, focusing mainly on polyphenols and flavonoids. Phytocosmetic products offer advantages over synthetic chemicals, including avoiding endocrine disruption and promoting sustainability through the use of agricultural waste. However, barriers such as the low bioavailability and chemical instability of some plant ingredients require innovative delivery systems, and the use of organic solvents can be mitigated by environmentally friendly extraction techniques. Specific regulatory guidelines for phytocosmetic products are lacking, requiring the establishment of science-based quality and safety standards. Further research is needed to understand the potential adverse effects and mechanisms of action of plant-derived ingredients on the skin.},

	abstract = {Quelle est la couleur d'une robe lorsqu'une personne ne la regarde ? Qu'elle soit domestiquée par l'homme ou elle "pense par elle-même", comme l'écrivait Baudelaire, la couleur reflète toujours les regards et les préoccupations des sociétés qui l'ont produite et utilisée. Depuis longtemps, les historiens de l'art, en nous faisant pénétrer dans le champs de vision du peintre, nous ont ainsi appris à en découvrir l'environnement économique, social, culturel, idéologique et symbolique. Aujourd'hui, le développement de nouvelles techniques - détection optique instrumentale et scanner, spectrométries électronique et vibrationnelle, imagerie et fausses couleurs - a changé le concept même de la couleur. Les recherches des historiens de l'art sont désormais confrontées aux investigations des archéologues, des chimistes, des physiciens, des linguistes et des informaticiens. La formule chimique identifiant un cristal coloré côtoie le lexique du philologue, le programme de l'ordinateur, la grille du sociologue et la vision subjective du peintre. Tous ces regards différents, toutes ces techniques élargies et sans cesse renouvelées nécessitent une appréhension neuve des peintures et des teintures que les siècles, parfois les millénaires, nous ont transmises.},

	abstract = {Identification of natural products capable of affording protection against {UVB} radiation-induced inflammatory responses and generation of oxidative stress may have important human health implications. The {UVB} exposure-induced skin injury and oxidative stress has been associated with a variety of skin disease conditions including photoaging, inflammation and cancer. Tea is a popular beverage consumed worldwide. In several mouse skin models, topical application as well as oral consumption of green tea has been shown to afford protection against chemical and {UVB}-induced carcinogenesis and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we investigated in human skin, whether topical application of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}), the major polyphenolic constituent in green tea, inhibits {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes (macrophage/neutrophils), a potential source of generation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}), and generation of prostaglandin ({PG}) metabolites. Human subjects were {UVB} irradiated on sun-protected skin to four times their minimal erythema dosage ({MED}) and skin biopsies or keratomes were obtained either 24 h or 48 h later. We found that topical application of {EGCG} (3 mg/2.5 cm2) before {UVB} (4 {MED}) exposure to human skin significantly blocked {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes and reduced myeloperoxidase activity. These infiltrating leukocytes are considered to be the major source of generation of {ROS}. In the same set of experiments we found that topical application of {EGCG} before {UVB} exposure decreased {UVB}-induced erythema. In additional experiments, we found that microsomes from {EGCG} pretreated human skin and exposed to {UVB}, compared to {UVB} exposure alone, produced significantly reduced {PG} metabolites, particularly {PGE}2. The {PG} metabolites play a critical role in free radical generation and skin tumor promotion in multistage skin carcinogenesis. Careful microscopic examination of skin sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, under higher magnification (x400) also revealed that {EGCG} pretreated and {UVB}-exposed human skin contained fewer dead cells in the epidermis with comparison to nonpretreated {UVB}-exposed skin. Taken together, our data demonstrate that {EGCG} has the potential to block the {UVB}-induced infiltration of leukocytes and the subsequent generation of {ROS} in human skin. This may explain the possible mechanism involved in anti-inflammatory effects of green tea. We suggest that {EGCG} may be useful as a topical agent for protection against {UVB}-induced {ROS}-associated inflammatory dermatoses, photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. Further studies are warranted in this direction.},

	abstract = {Acne is a highly prevalent inflammatory skin condition involving sebaceous sties. Although it clearly develops from an interplay of multiple factors, the exact cause of acne remains elusive. It is increasingly believed that the interaction between skin microbes and host immunity plays an important role in this disease, with perturbed microbial composition and activity found in acne patients. Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes; formerly called Propionibacterium acnes) is commonly found in sebum-rich areas and its over-proliferation has long been thought to contribute to the disease. However, information provided by advanced metagenomic sequencing has indicated that the cutaneous microbiota in acne patients and acne-free individuals differ at the virulent-specific lineage level. Acne also has close connections with the gastrointestinal tract, and many argue that the gut microbiota could be involved in the pathogenic process of acne. The emotions of stress (e.g., depression and anxiety), for instance, have been hypothesized to aggravate acne by altering the gut microbiota and increasing intestinal permeability, potentially contributing to skin inflammation. Over the years, an expanding body of research has highlighted the presence of a gut–brain–skin axis that connects gut microbes, oral probiotics, and diet, currently an area of intense scrutiny, to acne severity. This review concentrates on the skin and gut microbes in acne, the role that the gut–brain–skin axis plays in the immunobiology of acne, and newly emerging microbiome-based therapies that can be applied to treat acne.},

(licorice) extract for the treatment of hyperpigmentation.Methods:Two fractions, one enriched with glabridin ({FEG}) and the other enriched with liquiritin ({FEL}), were obtained by partitioning the methanol ({MeOH}) extract of licorice roots with ethyl acetate ({EtOAc}) and partitioning the {EtOAc} fraction with butanol (n-{BuOH}) and water. The quantities of glabridin (Glab) and liquiritin ({LQ}) in the fractions were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}). {FEG} and {FEL} were loaded in different {NLC} formulations, and surface characterization and long-term stability were studied using Dynamic Light Scattering ({DLS}). The best formulation was chosen for further surface characterization, including Transmission Electron Microscopy ({TEM}), Differential Scanning Calorimetry ({DSC}), and Fouriertransform infrared ({FTIR}) spectroscopy. Moreover, entrapment efficiency percentage ({EE}\%), in vitro drug release, in vivo skin penetration, cytotoxicity on B16F10 melanoma cells, effect on melanin production, and anti- tyrosinase activity were tested for the selected formulation.Results:Based on {HPLC} results, {FEG} contained 34.501 mg/g of Glab, and {FEL} contained 31.714 mg/g of {LQ}. Among 20 different formulations, {NLC} 20 ({LG}-{NLCs}) showed desirable {DLS} results with a Z-average size of 185.3 ± 1.08 nm, polydispersity index ({PDI}) of 0.229 ± 0.35, and zeta potential of -16.2 ± 1.13 {mV}. It indicated good spherical shape, high {EE}\% (79.01\% for Glab and 69.27\% for {LQ}), two-stage release pattern (an initial burst release followed by sustained release), efficient in vivo skin penetration, and strong anti-tyrosinase activity. {LG}-{NLCs} had acceptable physiochemical stability for up to 9 months and were non-cytotoxic.Conclusion:The {LG}-{NLC} formulation has revealed desirable surface characterization, good physiochemical stability, efficient drug release pattern and in vivo penetration, and high {EE}\%. Therefore, it can be a suitable nanosystem for the delivery of licorice extract in the treatment of hyperpigmentation.},

The present study investigated the preventive and repair effects of the H. annuus seed byproduct ethanol extract ({HSE}) on ultraviolet radiation ({UVR})-induced injury in human immortalized keratinocytes ({HaCaTs}) and human skin fibroblasts ({HSFs}). Results revealed that the total phenolic acid and oligosaccharide content in {HSE} was {\textgreater}50\%. {HSE} had a stronger preventive effect on {UVR}-induced injury than the repair effect. Moreover, phenolic acids were the main active component of {HSE} mediating the preventative effect.

It reduced the secretion of tumor necrosis {TNF}-α, {IL}-1α, {IL}-1β, {IL}-6, and {IL}-8 by inhibiting the level of {ROS}, thus reducing inflammation-mediated injury to skin cells. In addition, {HSE} inhibited the expression of various {mRNA} kinases in the {MAPK}-{ERK}/p38/{JNK} pathway. This downregulated the expression of activator protein-1 ({AP}-1) {mRNA} and further reduced the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase ({MMP})-1, {MMP}-3, and {MMP}-9 as well as reduced {UVR}-induced injury to the cells.

We have demonstrated that dietary administration of the naturally occurring chemopreventive agents, ellagic acid, coumarin or alpha-angelicalactone caused an increase in {GLCL} activity of between approximately 3- and 5-fold in rat liver. Treatment with the synthetic antioxidant ethoxyquin or the classic inducer phenobarbital caused {\textless} 2-fold induction of {GLCL} activity in rat liver, which was not found to be significant. The increases in {GLCL} activity were accompanied by increases (between 2- and 4-fold) in levels of both the catalytic heavy subunit ({GLCLC}) and regulatory light subunit ({GLCLR}). No substantial induction of {GLCL} was observed in rat kidney. The glutathione S-transferase ({GST}) subunits A1, A3, A4, A5, P1 and M1 were all found to be inducible in rat liver by most of the agents. The greatest levels of induction were observed for {GST} P1, following treatment with coumarin (20-fold), alpha-angelicalactone (10-fold) or ellagic acid (6-fold), and {GST} A5, following treatment with coumarin (7-fold), alpha-angelicalactone (6-fold) and ethoxyquin (6-fold). Glutathione synthetase was induced approximately 1.5-fold by coumarin, alpha-angelicalactone, ellagic acid and ethoxyquin. The expression of glutathione-related enzymes was also examined in preneoplastic lesions induced in rat liver by aflatoxin B(1). The majority of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase ({GGT})-positive preneoplastic foci contained increased levels of {GLCLC} relative to the surrounding tissue. This was usually found to be accompanied by an increase in {GLCLR}. Cells in the inner cortex of rat kidney were found to contain the highest levels of both {GLCLC} and {GLCLR}. The same cells showed the strongest staining for {GGT} activity.},

              Background and Objective
              Deep coagulation of skin collagen by Er:{YAG} laser repetitive pulses has been predicted by previous theoretical models and later demonstrated on animal skin. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of repetitive Er:{YAG} laser pulses on human skin and its response to this treatment.
            
            
              Study Design/Materials and Methods
              
                Lid skin of six female volunteers with blepharochalasis has been treated with laser at day 0, 7, and 21 before elective surgery—blepharoplasty. The treated skin was excised as part of the procedure and prepared for further histological examination. We used a 2,940 nm Er:{YAG} laser (Fidelis M320A by Fotona) with ‘smooth’ mode parameters: fluence from 0.50 to 2.00 J/cm
                2
                ; six pulses per packet; 550 μsecond/pulse, 250 millisecond/packet; single pass, no overlapping; spot size 5 mm; repetition rate 20 Hz.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                We observed deep collagen denaturation at laser fluences of 1.25 J/cm
                2
                and over; epidermal damage was proportional to fluence with total coagulation of the epidermal layer at fluences of 1.75 J/cm
                2
                and over. At day 7 after laser treatment we observed a complete regeneration of the epidermal layer and a regeneration zone within the dermis with prominent infiltration of {CD}68+ monocytes/macrophages. At day 21 after laser treatment we observed collagen remodeling and (myo‐)fibroblast proliferation at tissue depths of up to 240 μm.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Repetitive Er:{YAG} laser irradiation is effective in deep denaturation and remodeling of human skin collagen in vivo, with less epidermal damage compared to standard Er:{YAG} laser skin resurfacing. Lasers Surg. Med. 35:146–151, 2004. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Retinoic acid was identified as the biologically active form of vitamin A almost 70 years ago, but the exact enzymes and control mechanisms that regulate its biosynthesis and degradation are yet to be fully defined. The currently accepted model postulates that {RA} is produced in two sequential oxidative steps: first, retinol is oxidized reversibly to retinaldehyde, and then retinaldehyde is oxidized irreversibly to {RA}, which is inactivated by conversion to hydroxylated derivatives. This chapter describes the history, development and recent advances in our understanding of the enzymatic pathways and mechanisms that control the rate of {RA} production and degradation. Gene knockout studies provided strong evidence that the members of the short chain dehydrogenase reductase superfamily of proteins play indispensable roles in retinoic acid biosynthesis during development. Furthermore, recent finding that two of these proteins regulate the rate of retinoic acid biosynthesis by mutually activating each other provided a novel insight into the mechanism of this regulation. Despite significant progress made since the middle of the 20th century many unanswered questions still remain, and there is much to be learned, especially about trafficking of the hydrophobic retinoid substrates between membrane bound and cytosolic enzymes and the roles of the retinoid binding proteins.},

{OBJECTIVES}: Within this study, we aimed to provide comprehensive and evidence-based information on retinoid stability and degradation kinetics in commercial cosmetics, focusing on different factors affecting their stability.
{METHODS}: A validated {HPLC}-{UV} methodology was utilized for determination of the most common retinoids in cosmetics (retinol, retinyl palmitate, β-carotene) and a newer promising retinoid (hydroxypinacolone retinoate). The stability of 16 retinoid derivatives in 12 commercial cosmetics was evaluated within 6 months of long-term and accelerated stability testing in addition to a one-week photostability study. Retinoid degradation in the tested formulations followed first-order kinetics, which was further applied to shelf-life prediction.
{RESULTS}: Long-term and accelerated stability testing revealed retinoid instabilities in almost all products, resulting in a 0\%-80\% decline after 6 months at 25°C and a 40\%-100\% decline at 40°C, which were kinetically evaluated. Light degradation was more pronounced than temperature-induced degradation. Among the studied retinoids, the stability of the newer hydroxypinacolone retinoate was the most prominent. This study also identifies correlations between retinoid concentrations, price, formulation, and their stability in cosmetics.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Retinoid instabilities were formulation-dependent and associated with lower contents than declared in some cosmetics. Retinoid chemical stability and physical stability in topical formulations need to be evaluated by real-time stability studies, instead of the more frequently used accelerated stability studies.},

Au niveau mondial, le recours aux médicaments issus des pharmacopées traditionnelles est un sujet majeur. La confiance des populations dans ces médicaments est liée à leur présomption d’innocuité et aussi au fait que géographiquement et financièrement ils sont plus accessibles que les médicaments synthétiques. Compte tenu de la forte exposition de la population mondiale aux médicaments traditionnels, ces derniers font l’objet d’une pharmacovigilance garantissant leur sécurité d’utilisation. Ainsi, la présente revue vise à faire le point sur les risques identifiés par les systèmes nationaux de pharmacovigilance.

Ces travaux montrent que l’utilisation des médicaments traditionnels peut comporter des risques comprenant effets indésirables, toxicité, interactions avec les médicaments synthétiques, adultération et contamination. Le système de notification spontanée a été la base de leur identification. Le renforcement de ce système et la prise de conscience des populations sur ces risques constituent les leviers clefs du progrès de la pharmacovigilance des médicaments traditionnels.
Summary
Globally, the use of drugs from traditional pharmacopoeias is a major subject. The confidence of the populations in these drugs is linked to their presumption of safety and also to the fact that geographically and financially they are more accessible than synthetic drugs. In view of the high exposure of the world population to traditional medicines, they are subject to pharmacovigilance guaranteeing their safety in use. Thus, this review aims to take stock of the risks identified by the national pharmacovigilance systems. It is based on research referenced in {PubMed}, Embase, {ScienceDirect} and {GoogleScholar}. These studies indicate that the use of traditional drugs can involve risks including adverse effects, interactions with synthetic drugs, adulteration and contamination. The spontaneous notification system was the basis for their identification. Strengthening this system and making populations aware of these risks constitute the key levers for traditional medicines pharmacovigilance progress.},

The modulation of the expression of different inflammatory, keratinocytes differentiation and neurites growth markers was assessed. {PM} samples contained a high proportion of particles with a size below 1 μm and a complex chemical composition. Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that {PM} altered keratinocytes terminal differentiation and induced an inflammatory response. While viability and functionality of the {SN} were not modified, their outgrowth was significantly decreased after incubation with {PM}-exposed Episkin® supernatants. This was closely related to the modification of nerve growth factor/semaphorin 3A balance. This study showed that air pollutants have negative effects on keratinocytes and sensory nerve endings including inflammatory responses. These effects are probably involved in the {SS} pathophysiology and might be involved in inflammatory skin disorders.},

The gut-skin axis explains a bidirectional interaction between skin and gut microbiota in some inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or rosacea. The introduction and consolidation of the next-generation sequencing in recent years has provided unprecedented information about the microbiome. However, the characterization of the gut and skin microbiota and the impact of the gut-skin axis in patients with rosacea has been little explored, in contrast to other inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Furthermore, the clinical evolution of patients with rosacea is not always adequate and it is common for them to present a sustained symptomatology with frequent flare-ups. In this context, probiotic supplementation could improve the clinical evolution of these patients as happens in other pathologies. Through this review we aim to establish and compile the basics and directions of current knowledge to understand the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences the pathogenesis of rosacea, and how modulation of the skin and gut microbiota could benefit these patients.},

	abstract = {Introduction

Specific triterpenes, phenolic acids and flavonoids in Centella asiatica have been found to be bioactive. Harvesting the plant when these putative bioactive compounds are at their highest concentrations would provide consistency in their chemical profile, thus ensuring the quality and efficacy of derived medicinal products.



Objective

The aim of the study was to determine the impact of harvesting time on the contents of major triterpenoid and phenolic compounds in C. asiatica.



Methodology

Australian C. asiatica was collected from a designated area in different months. The principal triterpenes (asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid and madecassic acid), flavonoid compounds (rutin, quercetin and kaempferol) and chlorogenic acid were quantitatively determined by {HPLC}-{DAD} analysis.



Results

Triterpenoid, kaempferol and chlorogenic acid content showed significant variation (p{\textless}0.05) in different collecting months. The total content of the four triterpenes reached its highest levels in January and February (83.15±0.16mg/g and 78.41±0.16mg/g, respectively), the summer season of the southern hemisphere, and their lowest values in winter (June) and spring (October) seasons (35.65±0.20 and 35.50±0.55mg/g, respectively). Similarly, the contents of chlorogenic acid and kaempferol were the highest in December and January (1.62±0.01 and 0.33±0.01mg/g, respectively), and the lowest in June (0.06±0.01 and 0.09±0.01mg/g, respectively).



Conclusion

The results indicate that harvesting C. asiatica in summer returns the highest yield of the target triterpenoids, kaempferol and chlorogenic acid. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) are necessary for normal cell signaling and the antimicrobial defense of the skin. However excess production of {ROS} can disrupt the cellular redox balance and overwhelm the cellular antioxidant ({AO}) capacity, leading to oxidative stress. In the skin, oxidative stress plays a key role in driving both extrinsic and intrinsic aging. Sunlight exposure has also been a major contributor to extrinsic photoaging of the skin as its oxidising components disrupt both redox- and iron-homeostasis, promoting oxidative damage to skin cells and tissue constituents. Upon oxidative insults, the interplay between excess accumulation of {ROS} and redox-active labile iron ({LI}) and its detrimental consequences to the skin are often overlooked. In this review we have revisited the oxidative mechanisms underlying skin damage and aging by focussing on the concerted action of {ROS} and redox-active {LI} in the initiation and progression of intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging processes. Based on these, we propose to redefine the selection criteria for skin antiaging and photoprotective ingredients to include natural antioxidants ({AOs}) exhibiting robust redox-balancing and/or iron-chelating properties. This would promote the concept of natural-based or bio-inspired bifunctional anti-aging and photoprotective ingredients for skincare and sunscreen formulations with both {AO} and iron-chelating properties.},

	abstract = {Because of its antioxidant, antimutagenic, and anti-infectious properties, epigallocatechin gallate ({EGCG}) is the most interesting compound among the green tea catechins polyphenols. However, its health effects are inconclusive due to its very low bioavailability, largely due to a particular instability that does not allow {EGCG} to reach the potency required for clinical developments. Over the last decade, many efforts have been made to improve the stability and bioavailability of {EGCG} using complex delivery systems such as nanotechnology, but these efforts have not been successful and easy to translate to industrial use. To meet the needs of a large-scale clinical trial requiring {EGCG} in a concentrated solution to anticipate swallowing impairments, we developed an {EGCG}-based aqueous solution in the simplest way while trying to circumvent {EGCG} instability. The solution was thoroughly characterized to sort out the unexpected stability outcome by combining experimental ({HPLC}-{UV}-mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy) and computational (density functional theory) studies. Against all odds, the {EGCG}–sucrose complex under certain conditions may have prevented {EGCG} from degradation in aqueous media. Indeed, in agreement with the {ICH} guidelines, the formulated solution was shown to be stable up to at least 24 months under 2–8 °C and at ambient temperature. Furthermore, considerable improvement in bioavailability in rats, against {EGCG} powder formulated in hard-gel capsules, was shown after gavage. Thus, the proposed formulation may provide an easily implementable platform to administer {EGCG} in the context of clinical development.},

{OBJECTIVE}: The primary objective is to shed the light and summarize the existing literature on skin aging exposome in {SOC} populations.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: We performed an extensive search in the {PubMed} and Google Scholar databases. We included peer-reviewed studies in {SOC} populations around the world regarding one or more of the skin aging exposome factors, and we grouped and organized the studies under each factor of the skin aging exposome.
{RESULTS}: Some environmental exposome factors are preventable or modifiable, for example, by applying broad-spectrum sunscreens with visible light protection, improving nutrition, and smoking cessation. Other factors such as air pollution will require more complex solutions. Our search revealed a paucity of references on skin aging exposome factors in {SOC} populations.

Intrinsic aging is associated with programmed aging and cellular senescence, which are caused by endogenous oxidative stress and cellular damage. Extrinsic aging is the result of environmental factors, such as ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation and pollution, and leads to the production of reactive oxygen species, ultimately causing {DNA} damage and cellular dysfunction. In aged skin, senescent cells accumulate and contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, which further contributes to the aging process. To combat the symptoms of aging, various topical agents and clinical procedures such as chemical peels, injectables, and energy-based devices have been developed. These procedures address different symptoms of aging, but to devise an effective anti-aging treatment protocol, it is essential to thoroughly understand the mechanisms of skin aging.

Key signalling pathways are integral in coordinating the development of the epidermis, hair follicles, and sweat glands. The complex interplay among these pathways is vital for the appropriate formation and functionality of the skin. Disruptions in multiple molecular pathways can give rise to a spectrum of skin diseases, from congenital skin disorders to cancers.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Microbial dysbiosis with increased Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonization on the skin is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis ({AD}), however most microbiome studies focus on bacteria in the flexures and the microbial composition at other body sites have not been studied systematically.
{OBJECTIVES}: The aim of the study is to characterize the skin microbiome, including bacteria, fungi and virus, at different body sites in relation to {AD}, lesional state, and S. aureus colonization, and to test whether the nares could be a reservoir for S. aureus strain colonization.
{METHODS}: Using shotgun metagenomics we characterized microbial compositions from 14 well defined skin sites from 10 patients with {AD} and 5 healthy controls.
{RESULTS}: We found clear differences in microbial composition between {AD} and controls at multiple skin sites, most pronounced on the flexures and neck. The flexures exhibited lower alpha-diversity and were colonized by S. aureus, accompanied by S. epidermidis in lesions. Malassezia species were absent on the neck in {AD}. Virus mostly constituted Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus phages, with increased abundance of Propionibacterium phages {PHL}041 and {PHL}092 and Staphylococcus epidermidis phages {CNPH}82 and {PH}15 in {AD}. In lesional samples, both the genus Staphylococcus and Staphylococcus phages were more abundant. S. aureus abundance was higher across all skin sites except from the feet. In samples where S. aureus was highly abundant, lower abundances of S. hominis and Cutibacterium acnes were observed. M. osloensis and M. luteus were more abundant in {AD}. By single nucleotide variant analysis of S. aureus we found strains to be subject specific. On skin sites some S. aureus strains were similar and some dissimilar to the ones in the nares.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our data indicate a global and site-specific dysbiosis in {AD}, involving both bacteria, fungus and virus. When defining targeted treatment clinicians should both consider the individual and skin site and future research into potential crosstalk between microbiota in {AD} yields high potential.},

The maturation process of the skin starts at birth with the adaption of the skin to the comparatively dry environment compared to the in utero milieu. This adaptive flexibility results in the unique properties of infant skin. To deliver appropriate care to infant skin, it is necessary to understand that it is evolving with unique characteristics., Recent Advances: The role of biophysical noninvasive techniques in the assessment of skin development underlines the importance of an objective evaluation of skin physiology parameters. Skin hydration, transepidermal water loss, and {pH} values are measurable with specific instruments that give us an accurate and reproducible assessment during infant skin maturation. The recording of these values, following standard measurement procedures, allows us to evaluate the integrity of the skin barrier and to monitor the functionality of the maturing skin over time., Critical Issues: During the barrier development, impaired skin function makes the skin vulnerable to chemical damage, microbial infections, and skin diseases, possibly compromising the general health of the infant. Preterm newborns, during the first weeks of life, have an even less developed skin barrier and, therefore, are even more at risk. Thus, it is extremely important to evaluate the risk of infection, skin breakdown, topical agent absorption, and the risk of thermoregulation failure., Future Directions: Detailed and objective evaluations of infant skin maturation are necessary to improve infant skin care. The results of these evaluations should be formed into general protocols that will allow doctors and caregivers to give more personalized care to full-term newborns, preterm newborns, and infants.},

The skin's elixir for maintaining tissue homeostasis, regenerating hair, and repairing the epidermis after injury is its stem cells, which reside in the adult hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and epidermis. Stem cells have the remarkable capacity to both self-perpetuate and also give rise to the differentiating cells that constitute one or more tissues. In recent years, scientists have begun to uncover the properties of skin stem cells and unravel the mysteries underlying their remarkable capacity to perform these feats. In this paper, I outline the basic lineages of the skin epithelia and review some of the major findings about mammalian skin epithelial stem cells that have emerged in the past five years.},

The body is covered mostly by hairy (non‐glabrous) skin, which is typically insulated from the environment (with clothes in humans and with fur in non‐human mammals). Thermal signals from hairy skin represent a temperature of the insulated superficial layer of the body and provide feedback to the thermoregulation system. It is explained that this feedback is auxiliary, both negative and positive, and that it reduces the system's response time and load error. Non‐hairy (glabrous) skin covers specialized heat‐exchange organs (e.g. the hand), which are also used to explore the environment. In thermoregulation, these organs are primarily effectors. Their main thermosensory‐related role is to assess local temperatures of objects explored; these local temperatures are feedforward signals for various behaviours. Non‐hairy skin also contributes to the feedback for thermoregulation, but this contribution is limited. Autonomic (physiological) thermoregulation does not use feedforward signals. Thermoregulatory behaviours use both feedback and feedforward signals. Implications of these principles to thermopharmacology, a new approach to achieving biological effects by blocking temperature signals with drugs, are discussed.},

The epidermis accounted for 3.7-16.8\% of the entire skin in most regions, except in the palm and sole (40.6-44.6\%). Thickness data may be useful in harvesting full- or split-thickness skin grafts.},

Evidence is provided that {UVB} irradiation of isolated {DNA} in aqueous solutions and in cells gives rise to the predominant generation of cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers ({CPDs}) and, to a lesser extent, of pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs), the importance of which is strongly primary sequence dependent. A notable change in the photoproduct distribution is observed when {DNA} either in the dry or in desiccated microorganisms is exposed to {UVC} or {UVB} photons with an overwhelming formation of 5-(α-thymidyl)-5,6-dihydrothymidine, also called spore photoproduct ({dSP}), at the expense of {CPDs} and 6-4PPs. {UVA} irradiation of isolated and cellular {DNA} gives rise predominantly to bipyrimidine photoproducts with the overwhelming formation of thymine-containing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers at the exclusion of 6-4PPs. {UVA} photons have been shown to modulate the distribution of {UVB} dimeric pyrimidine photoproducts by triggering isomerization of the 6-4PPs into related Dewar valence isomers. Mechanistic aspects of the formation of bipyrimidine photoproducts are discussed in the light of recent photophysical and theoretical studies.},

Hydration of {DDHA} was analyzed as a function of concentration, {pH} and temperature. Above {pH} 5 only hydrated dehydroascorbic acid monomer ({DHA}) and its degradation product 2,3-diketogulonic acid ({DKG}) were observed. At {pH} lower than4 and in {MilliQ} water, relatively stable hydrated dimeric species were additionally detected. They are intermediates formed from {DDHA} and transformed into {DKG}, either directly or through {DHA}. A lower temperature of dissolution favours the formation of hydrated dimeric products, while the concentration of {DDHA} has no effect on their yield. All products were separated chromatographically and analyzed by three detectors: diode array, refractive index and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. The stability and transformations of products were studied in the mixture and in the isolated fractions. Two initially formed monohydrated products are transformed to a dihydrated product that is degraded to {DHA} and {DKG}. Once formed, the dihydrated product and one of the monohydrated products are sufficiently stable to be identified at neutral {pH}. All three hydrated products are interconvertible and can be also formed after dissolution of dried {DHA}.},

	abstract = {(−)-Epigallocatechin gallate ({EGCG}) has become a popular disease-preventive supplement worldwide because it may aid in slowing down the onset of age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes and tissue degeneration. As largely demonstrated in cell culture studies, {EGCG} possesses antioxidant properties and exhibits favorable effects on gene expression, signal transduction and other cell functions. However, only limited effects have been observed in experimental animals and human epidemiological studies. The inconsistency between the biological activity of {EGCG} in cell cultures and in vivo can be attributed to its low stability, which not only decreases its bioavailability but also leads to the formation of degradation products and prooxidant molecules with possible side-effects. Understanding {EGCG} degradation kinetics in solution and in vivo is crucial for its successful clinical application. Ambient conditions ({pH}, temperature, oxygen) can either enhance or decrease the stability of {EGCG}, thus influencing its biological activity. Usage of stabilizers and/or encapsulation of {EGCG} into particulate systems such as nanoparticles or microparticles can significantly increase its stability. In this review, the effects of ambient conditions, stabilizers and encapsulation systems on {EGCG} stability, activity and degradation rate are illustrated.},

The {EGCG} stability testing was obtained during extraction process by adding phosphoric acid buffer, {pH} 4 buffer solution and control. The stability of these groups then tested at 2, 25 and 40°C temperature. Evaluation for absorbance changing by {UV}-{VIS} spectrophotometry was obtained during 15 days. After that, {EGCG} concentration from the three groups were compared using {HPLC}. Antibacterial activity testing for acne causing bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis {ATCC} 35984 was conducted from phosphoric acid and {pH} 4 buffer solution groups. The result showed that extreme cold temperature decreasing treatment against green tea leaves extract after infundation, {pH} 4 buffer solution adding and storage at temperature of 2°C produced the highest {EGCG} concentration namely 60.98\% w/w. Besides that, antibacterial activity from the ethyl acetate fraction of green tea leaves extract by using this method produced a good inhibition against P. acnes and S. epidermidis. Moreover, the antibacterial activity against P. acnes was higher than S. epidermis. The adding of {pH} 4 buffer solution in extraction process produced the highest {EGCG} concentration than phosphoric acid adding and no buffer adding. The {EGCG} was stable at the storage temperature of 2°C and 6\% ethyl acetate fraction of green tea leaves extract can be used as an anti acne dosage.},

Curcumin is degraded drastically in the presence of light, but it is highly stable with the temperature. From this work it was deduced that the exposure of curcumin to light induces two possible effects (i) demethoxylation and (ii) isomerization of keto-enol to diketo form in curcumin and the formation of small sub-products such as methanol or acetate. {UV}–vis and Raman spectroscopy were important to determine the nature of the structural modifications.

	abstract = {The skin is the largest organ in the body and plays several essential functions acting as a barrier that protects us from physical and chemical insults, prevents the entrance of pathogens and the loss of water, besides playing an esential role in the regulation of body temperature. The skin displays a high regenerative capacity, evidenced by its self-renewing activity and the process of wound healing, driven by the existence of several resident stem cell populations. Due to the high prevalence of skin pathology, and their anatomical accessibility, skin biopsies and their subsequent microscopic observation constitute a powerfull tool for the study of primary skin diseases, as well as cutaneous manifestations of systemic diseases. This gave rise to dermatopathology as a specific discipline that unifies dermatology and pathology. In this setting, staining with hematoxylin and eosin constitutes the gold standard method for microscopic observation and diagnosis. Yet, several additional stains are used for specific purposes, such as trichrome stains for the staining of collagens in the extracellular matrix. We have applied a recently developed stain ({RGB} trichrome, acronym for picrosirius Red, fast Green and alcian Blue) to human samples to assess the staining outcomes in normal skin tissues. {RGB} staining provides a high contrasted interface between epidermis and dermis, and a comprehensible staining of the different dermal structures such as blood vessels, nerves, and sweat and sebaceous glands. The specific staining of collagens by picrosirius red can be useful for the objective quantification of these proteins under polarized light microscopy. In hair follicles, {RGB} staining resulted in specific staining of the epidermal sheaths and the encasing connective tissue (i.e., dermal sheath). Interestingly, the dermal sheath show two domains in which blue predominates over red staining, thus indicating that proteoglycans prevail in these areas. These two zones are the dermal papilla and an uncharacterized zone located at the upper isthmus, that we have denominated as proteoglycan-enriched belt ({PEB}). While the role of the papilla in the induction and regulation of hair growth is clearly established, the possible role of {PEB} remains to be determined and merits additional investigation.},

The kinetic analyses carried out provided Arrhenius activation energies, enthalpies, entropies and Gibb’s free energies of activation, temperature coefficients, Q10 factors, and the oxidative stability indexes at 20°C ({OSI}20) for the different oils. A good correlation between the two techniques was obtained (r2 = 0.996). Oxitest showed, however, shorter induction times and less sample quantity (1 g vs. 3 g in Rancimat) requirements, suggesting that it could be a good and faster alternative to Rancimat for the evaluation of the oil oxidative stability. {cOO} showed {OSI}20 values of 38.5 and 42.5 months, by the Rancimat and Oxitest methods, respectively. Furthermore, {eOO} and {SCOO} showed {OSI}20 values of 43.3 and 138.6 months by Rancimat and 67 and 142 months by the Oxitest method, respectively. The strong correlation found between the phenolic content of the oils and their {OSI}20 values confirms that a higher oil phenolic content would improve the oxidative stability of the oils.},

The addition of butylated hydroxy toluene ({BHT}) improved {RE} stability, increasing its retention by 12.49\% after 4 h. Using isopropyl alcohol as the solvent inhibited {AR} formation from {RA} and {RP}, thereby increasing their retention by 17.12\% and 16.26\%, respectively, compared to ethanol.

Unfortunately, {EGCG} presents disappointing bioavailability after oral administration, primarily due to its chemical instability and poor absorption. Due to these limitations, {EGCG} is currently not used in medication, but only as a dietary supplement in the form of green tea extract. Therefore, it needs further modifications before being considered suitable for extensive medical applications. In this article, we review the scientific literature about {EGCG} derivatives focusing on their biological properties and potential medical applications. The most common chemical modifications of epigallocatechin gallate rely on introducing fatty acid chains or sugar molecules to its chemical structure to modify solubility. Another frequently employed procedure is based on blocking {EGCG}'s hydroxyl groups with various substituents. Novel derivatives reveal interesting properties, of which, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor and antimicrobial, are especially important. It is worth noting that the most promising {EGCG} derivatives present higher stability and activity than base {EGCG}.},

	abstract = {Human skin has unique properties of which functioning as a physicochemical barrier is one of the most apparent. The human integument is able to resist the penetration of many molecules. However, especially smaller molecules can surpass transcutaneously. They are able to go by the corneal layer, which is thought to form the main deterrent. We argue that the molecular weight ({MW}) of a compound must be under 500 Dalton to allow skin absorption. Larger molecules cannot pass the corneal layer. Arguments for this "500 Dalton rule" are; 1) virtually all common contact allergens are under 500 Dalton, larger molecules are not known as contact sensitizers. They cannot penetrate and thus cannot act as allergens in man; 2) the most commonly used pharmacological agents applied in topical dermatotherapy are all under 500 Dalton; 3) all known topical drugs used in transdermal drug-delivery systems are under 500 Dalton. In addition, clinical experience with topical agents such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus and ascomycins gives further arguments for the reality of the 500 Dalton rule. For pharmaceutical development purposes, it seems logical to restrict the development of new innovative compounds to a {MW} of under 500 Dalton, when topical dermatological therapy or percutaneous systemic therapy or vaccination is the objective.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Erythema, characterized by the redness of the skin, is a common skin reaction triggered by various endogenous and exogenous factors. This response is often a result of the activation of underlying inflammatory mechanisms within the skin. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential benefits of applying a combination of skincare ingredients, namely allantoin, bisabolol, D-panthenol and dipotassium glycyrrhizinate ({AB}5D), in the modulation of inflammatory factors associated with erythema. Additionally, the study aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which these ingredients exert their combined actions to alleviate erythema-associated inflammation.
{METHODS}: Human epidermal keratinocytes were exposed to {UVB} and subsequently treated with {AB}5D. Transcriptomics profiling was performed to analyse the dose-response effect of {AB}5D treatment on keratinocytes. The quantitation of inflammatory mediators, including {PGE}2, {IL}-1α, {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {IL}-1RA and {TNFα}, was performed on cultured media. Additionally, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity ({ORAC}) assay was carried out to evaluate the total antioxidant capacity of both individual ingredients and the {AB}5D combination. To assess the in-vitro antioxidant effects of {AB}5D against {UVB}-induced oxidative stress in {hTERT} keratinocytes, real-time quantitation of mitochondrial superoxide was measured through live-cell imaging.
{RESULTS}: The application of {AB}5D to {UVB}-exposed keratinocytes downregulated gene sets associated with inflammatory responses, highlighting the anti-inflammatory properties of {AB}5D. Specifically, {AB}5D effectively reduced the production of {PGE}2, leading to the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, our findings indicate that {AB}5D exhibits antioxidative capabilities, functioning as both an antioxidant agent and a regulator of antioxidant enzyme expression to counteract the detrimental effects of cellular oxidative stress.
{CONCLUSION}: We demonstrated that {AB}5D can reduce {UVB}-induced {PGE}2, {IL}-1α, {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {IL}-1RA and {TNFα} as well as mitochondrial superoxide. These findings suggest that {AB}5D may alleviate erythema by modulating inflammation via {PGE}2 and through antioxidation mechanisms.},

In this authoritative and comprehensive volume, the authors explain the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity on access and benefit-sharing, the effect of national laws to implement these, and aspects of typical contracts for the transfer of materials. They provide a unique sector-by-sector analysis of how genetic resources are used, the scientific, technological and regulatory trends and the different markets in Pharmaceuticals, Botanical Medicines, Crop Development, Horticulture, Crop Protection, Biotechnology (in fields other than healthcare and agriculture) and Personal Care and Cosmetics Products. This will be an essential sourcebook for all those in the commercial chain, from raw material collection to product discovery, development and marketing, for governments and policy-makers drafting laws on access and for all the institutions, communities and individuals involved in the conservation, use, study and commercialisation of genetic resources},

Dihydromyrcenol has the least change in thermal stress. Despite the similarities in the chemical structure of citronellyl nitrile and lemonile, both compounds exhibited different decomposition rates, limiting their possible use as indicators in long term stability tests. The carbonyl ({CO}) in citral was significantly influenced by thermal stress and exhibited the most notable changes in the sensory scent tests and the spectroscopic analyses. Additionally, it was confirmed that the carbonyl ({CO}) functionality in a body mist carrier solution was susceptible to decomposition when the formulation of the body mist contained citral (14.5\%) and other cosmetic materials such as ethanol and propylene glycol. This study presents the first attempt at establishing the correlation between the structural changes in the component chemicals of cosmetics and the observed fragrance related changes. These findings provide evidence for the feasibility of using carbonyl functional groups as indicators of long term stability in cosmetic products and may lead to the development of new sensory test protocols.},

Topical applications of basic skin care products seem to reduce skin tear incidence. The suction blister method leads to the artificial and controlled separation of dermis and epidermis. Therefore, time to blister formation may be used as outcome measuring the strength of dermo‐epidermal adhesion. We conducted an exploratory, randomised, controlled trial with a split‐body design on forearms in healthy female subjects (n = 12; mean age 70.3 [{SD} 2.1] years). Forearms assigned to the intervention were treated twice daily with petrolatum for 8 weeks. Suction blisters were induced on forearms after 4 and 8 weeks and time to blister formation was measured. Stratum corneum and epidermal hydration were measured and epidermal thickness was assessed via optical coherence tomography. Time to blistering was longer and stratum corneum as well as epidermal hydration was consistently higher in intervention skin areas. We conclude that topical application of basic skin care products may improve mechanical adhesion of the dermo‐epidermal junction and that the parameter “time to blistering” is a suitable outcome to measure dermo‐epidermal adhesion strength in clinical research.},

With aging and chronic ultraviolet ({UV}) exposure, the skin becomes thin and loses elasticity, and wrinkles, pigmentation, and texture irregularities appear. Today, people of all ages become interested in the cosmetic industry, aiming to make their skin appropriate to their age or look younger. Bakuchiol is a pure meroterpene phenol found mainly in the seeds of the Indian plant Psoralea corylifolia (babchi). It triggers antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and has anti-aging properties like retinol. The study aimed to know the effect of bakuchiol on the skin aging process.
Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Data were collected and synthesized from online databases with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses ({PRISMA}) protocol.
Results: More than 125 articles were found, and six studies were selected according to this research. Of the six existing clinical trial studies, all showed that bakuchiol had a beneficial effect on reducing signs of skin aging.
Conclusion: Bakuchiol has shown beneficial effects in preventing or reducing signs of skin aging, such as fine lines and wrinkles, loss of elasticity and firmness, dull skin, uneven hyperpigmentation, skin dryness, and texture irregularities, with minimal side effects.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Although often overlooked, the integument of many tetrapods is reinforced by a morphologically and structurally diverse assemblage of skeletal elements. These elements are widely understood to be derivatives of the once all‐encompassing dermal skeleton of stem‐gnathostomes but most details of their evolution and development remain confused and uncertain. Herein we re‐evaluate the tetrapod integumentary skeleton by integrating comparative developmental and tissue structure data. Three types of tetrapod integumentary elements are recognized: (1) osteoderms, common to representatives of most major taxonomic lineages; (2) dermal scales, unique to gymnophionans; and (3) the lamina calcarea, an enigmatic tissue found only in some anurans. As presently understood, all are derivatives of the ancestral cosmoid scale and all originate from scleroblastic neural crest cells. Osteoderms are plesiomorphic for tetrapods but demonstrate considerable lineage‐specific variability in size, shape, and tissue structure and composition. While metaplastic ossification often plays a role in osteoderm development, it is not the exclusive mode of skeletogenesis. All osteoderms share a common origin within the dermis (at or adjacent to the stratum superficiale) and are composed primarily (but not exclusively) of osseous tissue. These data support the notion that all osteoderms are derivatives of a neural crest‐derived osteogenic cell population (with possible matrix contributions from the overlying epidermis) and share a deep homology associated with the skeletogenic competence of the dermis. Gymnophionan dermal scales are structurally similar to the elasmoid scales of most teleosts and are not comparable with osteoderms. Whereas details of development are lacking, it is hypothesized that dermal scales are derivatives of an odontogenic neural crest cell population and that skeletogenesis is comparable with the formation of elasmoid scales. Little is known about the lamina calcarea. It is proposed that this tissue layer is also odontogenic in origin, but clearly further study is necessary. Although not homologous as organs, all elements of the integumentary skeleton share a basic and essential relationship with the integument, connecting them with the ancestral rhombic scale.},

Human diploid cell strains derived from adult lung have a significantly lower doubling potential in vitro than do fetal strains. The Phase {III} phenomenon may be related to senescence in vivo. The cellular theory of aging must be related to normal cells in vitro and not to heteroploid cell lines. The former have a finite period of multiplication; the latter are indefinitely cultivable. In vivo experiments also indicate that transplanted normal tissue has a finite lifetime. Chromosome anomalies occurring in Phase {III} may be related to such anomalies occurring in the cells of older animals, including man. The survival curves obtained with human diploid cell strains are comparable to “multiple-hit” or “multiple-target” curves obtained with other biological systems where an initial threshold dose is required before an exponential form of the curve is established. Whatever cell component(s) may be involved in the finite lifetime of human diploid cell strains, the ultimate accumulation of nondividing cells could be the result of accumulated damage to a single cellular target or to inactivation of many targets.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of damage is generally considered the cause of aging. Interventions that delay aging mobilize mechanisms that protect and repair cellular components. Consequently, research has been focused on studying the protective and homeostatic mechanisms within cells. However, in humans and other multicellular organisms, cells are surrounded by extracellular matrices ({ECMs}), which are important for tissue structure, function, and intercellular communication. During aging, components of the {ECM} become damaged through fragmentation, glycation, crosslinking, and accumulation of protein aggregation, all of which contribute to age-related pathologies. Interestingly, placing senescent cells into a young {ECM} rejuvenates them. Furthermore, we found that many longevity-assurances pathways reactivate de novo synthesis of {ECM} proteins during aging. This raises the question of what constitutes a young {ECM} to reverse aging or maintain health? In order to make inroads to answering this question, I suggest a systems-level approach of quantifying the matrisome or {ECM} compositions reflecting health, pathology, or phenotype and propose a novel term, the "matreotype," to describe this. The matreotype is defined as the composition and modification of {ECM} or matrisome proteins associated with or caused by a phenotype, such as longevity, or a distinct and acute physiological state, as observed during aging or disease. Every cell type produces its unique {ECM}. Intriguingly, cancer-cell types can even be identified based on their unique {ECM} composition. Thus, the matreotype reflects cellular identity and physiological status. Defined matreotypes could be used as biomarkers or prognostic factors for disease or health status during aging with potential relevance for personalized medicine. Treatment with biologics that alter {ECM}-to-cell mechanotransduction might be a strategy to reverse age-associated pathologies. An understanding of how to reverse from an old to a young matreotype might point toward novel strategies to rejuvenate cells and help maintain tissue homeostasis to promote health during aging.},

Dysbiosis has been described as the imbalance in skin microbiome homeostasis and may play a role in acne pathogenesis. Microbial interference has been shown to be a contributor to healthy skin homeostasis and staphylococcal strains may exclude acne-associated C. acnes phylotypes. In this review we present an update on the skin microbiome in acne and discuss how current acne treatments such as benzoyl peroxide, orally administered isotretinoin, and antibiotics may affect the skin microbiome homeostasis. We highlight the collateral damage of acne antibiotics on the skin microbiome, including the risk of antimicrobial resistance and the dysregulation of the microbiome equilibrium that may occur even with short-term antibiotic courses. Consequently, the interest is shifting towards new non-antibiotic pharmacological acne treatments. Orally administered spironolactone is an emerging off-label treatment for adult female patients and topical peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ({PPARγ}) modulation is being studied for patients with acne. The potential application of topical or oral probiotics, bacteriotherapy, and phage therapy for acne are further promising areas of future research.},

Moreover, these substances were added to the {UVB}-irradiated cells 1 h or 6 h before harvesting, depending on the established {UVB}-induced cytokine expression peak. Cytokine gene expression was examined using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. {RA} produced a significant reduction in {UVB}-induced expression of {IL}-6, {IL}-8, {MCP}-1, and {TNF}-α when applied at the same time as irradiation. {EA} showed milder effects compared with {RA}, except for {TNF}-α.

Many consumers choose “green cosmetics”, which are environmentally friendly creams, makeup, and beauty products, hoping that they are not harmful to health and reduce pollution. Moreover, the repeated mini-lock downs during the {COVID}-19 pandemic have fueled the awareness that body beauty is linked to well-being, both external and internal. As a result, consumer preferences for makeup have declined, while those for skincare products have increased. Nutricosmetics, which combines the benefits derived from food supplementation with the advantages of cosmetic treatments to improve the beauty of our body, respond to the new market demands. Food chemistry and cosmetic chemistry come together to promote both inside and outside well-being. A nutricosmetic optimizes the intake of nutritional microelements to meet the needs of the skin and skin appendages, improving their conditions and delaying aging, thus helping to protect the skin from the aging action of environmental factors. Numerous studies in the literature show a significant correlation between the adequate intake of these supplements, improved skin quality (both aesthetic and histological), and the acceleration of wound-healing. This review revised the main foods and bioactive molecules used in nutricosmetic formulations, their cosmetic effects, and the analytical techniques that allow the dosage of the active ingredients in the food.},

The vitamin C oxidation products thereby formed are investigated here. {DHA} and {DKG} were incubated aerobically at {pH} 4.7 with peroxide (H2O2), ‘superoxide’ (a ∼50 : 50 mixture of O2⋅− and {HO}2⋅), hydroxyl radicals (•{OH}, formed in Fenton mixtures), and illuminated riboflavin (generating singlet oxygen, 1O2). Products were monitored electrophoretically. {DHA} quenched H2O2 far more effectively than superoxide, but the main products in both cases were 4-O-oxalyl-l-threonate (4-{OxT}) and smaller amounts of 3-{OxT} and {OxA} + threonate. H2O2, but not superoxide, also yielded cyclic-{OxT}. Dilute Fenton mixture almost completely oxidised a 50-fold excess of {DHA}, indicating that it generated oxidant(s) greatly exceeding the theoretical •{OH} yield; it yielded oxalate, threonate, and {OxT}. 1O2 had no effect on {DHA}. {DKG} was oxidatively decarboxylated by H2O2, Fenton mixture, and 1O2, forming a newly characterised product, 2-oxo-l-threo-pentonate ({OTP}; ‘2-keto-l-xylonate’). Superoxide yielded negligible {OTP}. Prolonged H2O2 treatment oxidatively decarboxylated {OTP} to threonate. Oxidation of {DKG} by H2O2, Fenton mixture, or 1O2 also gave traces of 4-{OxT} but no detectable 3-{OxT} or cyclic-{OxT}. In conclusion, {DHA} and {DKG} yield different oxidation products when attacked by different {ROS}. {DHA} is more readily oxidised by H2O2 and superoxide; {DKG} more readily by 1O2. The diverse products are potential signals, enabling organisms to respond appropriately to diverse stresses.

The second and third parts of this work are devoted to the application of this approach to the quantitative interpretation of some important features of crystolysis reactions and identification of decomposition mechanisms for several classes of solids. The features of considered crystolysis reactions are the following: the mechanism of nucleation and autocatalytic development of decomposition reactions, the retardation of decomposition in the presence of gaseous products, the low vaporization coefficients αv for many substances, the effect of self-cooling on the measurement of kinetic parameters, the Topley–Smith effect and the kinetic compensation effect. The physical approach has been successfully applied to the interpretation of kinetics of sublimation/dissociative evaporation of more than 110 substances from 20 different classes of solids: metals, non-metals, oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, tellurides, nitrides, azides, carbides, borides, fluorides, chlorides, bromides, iodides, carbonates, nitrates, sulfates, oxalates and hydrates. As examples of unusual results obtained, two types of reaction mechanisms should be noted: the mechanism of low-temperature ({\textless}1000°C) ‘carbothermal reduction’ of Fe, Co, Ni and Cu oxides and the desorption mechanism of release of sub-nanogram masses of analytes from graphite and metal surfaces.

	abstract = {Structural and functional alterations, as well as changes occurring in the aspect of the skin during the ageing process, are due to some complex mechanisms, determined by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which act synergistically. This study aims to analyze the histological changes of collagen and elastic fibers and of skin vasculature that occur in time, during the process of ageing. Fragments of skin have been collected from subjects of both sexes and of different ages, totaling 121 samples from different body regions. The following stains were used: Modified Goldner's Masson trichrome, Ferric Orcein-Hematoxylin and the combined stains Orcein-Goldner's trichrome. As the process of ageing advances, collagen fibers become thinner and change their aspect; at advanced age, the lysis of collagen fibers and their thickening in the deep dermis is present, as they become more fibrous. Elastic fibers show the tendency of fragmentation at more advanced age, gradually change their tinctorial affinity and reduce in amount; in the deep dermis, they tend to thicken progressively, in the presence of discrete elastolysis processes that evolve steadily and irreversibly. Thus, processes of elastic fibers degeneration and lysis run faster by comparison with those of collagen fibers degeneration. With ageing, a progressive reduction of dermis vasculature is present, due to a reduction in the number and size of vascular vessels, which is in its turn associated with the progressive alterations of vascular walls components, changes that advance until the function of the vessel ceases.},

It has been traditionally believed that skin pigmentation is the most important photoprotective factor, as melanin, besides functioning as a broadband {UV} absorbent, has antioxidant and radical scavenging properties. Besides, many epidemiological studies have shown a lower incidence for skin cancer in individuals with darker skin compared to those with fair skin. Skin pigmentation is of great cultural and cosmetic importance, yet the role of melanin in photoprotection is still controversial. This article outlines the major acute and chronic effects of {UVR} on human skin, the properties of melanin, the regulation of pigmentation and its effect on skin cancer prevention.},

This review was compiled with the collaboration of European scientists, specialized in either environmental medicine or skin biology. A comprehensive review of the existing literature was performed using {PubMed}. The search was restricted to exposome factors and skin aging. Key review papers and all relevant, epidemiological, in vitro, ex vivo and clinical studies were analyzed to determine the key elements of the exposome influencing skin aging. Here we propose a definition of the skin aging exposome. It is based on a summary of the existing scientific evidence for the role of exposome factors in skin aging. We also identify future research needs which concern knowledge about the interaction of distinct exposomal factors with each other and the resulting net effects on skin aging and suggest some protective measures.},

	abstract = {The skin forms an effective barrier between the organism and the environment preventing invasion of pathogens and fending off chemical and physical assaults, as well as the unregulated loss of water and solutes. In this review we provide an overview of several components of the physical barrier, explaining how barrier function is regulated and altered in dermatoses. The physical barrier is mainly localized in the stratum corneum ({SC}) and consists of protein-enriched cells (corneocytes with cornified envelope and cytoskeletal elements, as well as corneodesmosomes) and lipid-enriched intercellular domains. The nucleated epidermis also contributes to the barrier through tight, gap and adherens junctions, as well as through desmosomes and cytoskeletal elements. During epidermal differentiation lipids are synthesized in the keratinocytes and extruded into the extracellular domains, where they form extracellular lipid-enriched layers. The cornified cell envelope, a tough protein/lipid polymer structure, resides below the cytoplasmic membrane on the exterior of the corneocytes. Ceramides A and B are covalently bound to cornified envelope proteins and form the backbone for the subsequent addition of free ceramides, free fatty acids and cholesterol in the {SC}. Filaggrin is cross-linked to the cornified envelope and aggregates keratin filaments into macrofibrils. Formation and maintenance of barrier function is influenced by cytokines, 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and calcium. Changes in epidermal differentiation and lipid composition lead to a disturbed skin barrier, which allows the entry of environmental allergens, immunological reaction and inflammation in atopic dermatitis. A disturbed skin barrier is important for the pathogenesis of contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.},

While it is predominantly observed in adolescents, it can affect individuals across all age groups. Acne pathogenesis is believed to be a result of various endogenous and exogenous factors, but the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Recent studies suggest that dysbiosis of the skin microbiota significantly contributes to acne development. Specifically, Cutibacterium acnes, the dominant resident bacterial species implicated in acne, plays a critical role in disease progression. Various treatments, including topical benzoyl peroxide, systemic antibiotics, and photodynamic therapy, have demonstrated beneficial effects on the skin microbiota composition in acne patients. Of particular interest is the therapeutic potential of probiotics in acne, given its direct influence on the skin microbiota. This review summarizes the alterations in skin microbiota associated with acne, provides insight into its pathogenic role in acne, and emphasizes the potential of therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring microbial homeostasis for acne management.},

The B3LYP structures and relative energies of the rotational isomers of oxalic acid are found very similar to {MP}2 results, confirming that the most stable isomer is the doubly intramolecular hydrogen-bonded C2h structure E1, with four other planar isomers within 6 kcal/mol. It is predicted that unimolecular formation of carbon dioxide and dihydroxycarbene ({DHC}) from oxalic acid has an activation barrier of 31 kcal/mol and that unimolecular formation of {HCOOH} from {DHC} has an activation barrier about 31 kcal/mol higher. The unimolecular formation of {CO}2, {CO} and H2O from oxalic acid via a concerted transition state has an activation barrier of only 42 kcal/mol, indicating it is a more favorable unimolecular decomposition channel. On the other hand, hydrogen migration from oxygen to carbon of {DHC} to produce {HCOOH} can be accomplished through a hydrogen exchange with H2O (a model for oxalic acid) with an activation barrier of less than 37 kcal/mol. Transition state theory calculations indicate that this bimolecular channel might be responsible for the rapid formation of {CO}2 and {HCOOH} in gas phase oxalic acid thermal decomposition, thus confirming the proposal of Bock and Redington. With increasing temperature the unimolecular channel to produce {CO}2, {CO}, and H2O might become significant.},

The major bioactive constituents of C. asiatica are the pentacyclic triterpenoid glycosides, asiaticoside and madecassoside, and their corresponding aglycones, asiatic acid and madecassic acid. Asiaticoside and madecassoside have been identified as the marker compounds of C. asiatica in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and these triterpene compounds offer a wide range of pharmacological properties, including neuroprotective, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, wound healing, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-allergic, anti-depressant, anxiolytic, antifibrotic, antibacterial, anti-arthritic, anti-tumour and immunomodulatory activities. Asiaticoside and madecassoside are also used extensively in treating skin abnormalities, burn injuries, ischaemia, ulcers, asthma, lupus, psoriasis and scleroderma. Besides medicinal applications, these phytocompounds are considered cosmetically beneficial for their role in anti-ageing, skin hydration, collagen synthesis, {UV} protection and curing scars. Existing reports and experimental studies on these compounds between 2005 and 2022 have been selectively reviewed in this article to provide a comprehensive overview of the numerous therapeutic advantages of asiaticoside and madecassoside and their potential roles in the medical future.},

The production processes of medicines and cosmetics often involve exposure to high temperatures, particularly during the final product sterilization phase. Hence, it's crucial to identify the "critical" temperatures for each component within the mixture for effective technological regulation. In light of this, the objective of this study was to examine the thermal inactivation, aggregation, and denaturation processes of three papain-like proteases: ficin, bromelain, papain. To achieve this goal, the following experiments were conducted: (1) determination of the quantity of inactivated proteases using enzyme kinetics with {BAPNA} as a substrate; (2) differential scanning calorimetry ({DSC}); (3) assessment of protein aggregation using dynamic light scattering ({DLS}) and spectrophotometric analysis at 280 nm. Our findings suggest that the inactivation of ficin and papain exhibits single decay step which characterized by a rapid decline, then preservation of the same residual activity by enzyme stabilization. Only bromelain shows two steps with different kinetics. The molecular sizes of the active and inactive forms are similar across ficin, bromelain, and papain. Furthermore, the denaturation of these forms occurs at approximately the same rate and is accompanied by protein aggregation.},

The major components of the essential oils were terpineol (E) Beta (55.5\%), terpinen-4-ol (15.9\%), and thymol (12.9\%) in oregano; camphor (35.7\%), verbenone (26.6\%), and β-caryophyllene (15.8\%) in rosemary {EO}; and linalool (45.0\%), sabinene (31.9\%), and methyl eugenol (14.3\%) in laurel {EO}. The volatile composition of the {EO} changed during the thermal stability study. The antioxidant activity of the essential oils was analyzed measuring free-radical scavenging activity ({FRSA}) and total phenolic content; and performing a storage study of sunflower oil measuring the formation of peroxide and volatile oxidation compounds. The {FRSA} showed that laurel (61.74\%), oregano (59.97\%), and rosemary (48.23\%) {EOs} showed better percentage inhibitions than {BHT} (8.76\%). In the storage study of sunflower oil, samples with 0.10\% oregano {EO}, 0.02\% oregano {EO}, 0.02\% laurel {EO}, and 0.10\% rosemary {EO} showed better antioxidant properties, exhibiting less peroxide and anisidine values during storage. Also, 0.02\% oregano {EO} in the storage study showed reduced formation of volatile compounds like hexanal, 2-heptenal, and 2,4-decadienal.

	abstract = {Significance
            Avian skin appendages include feathers, scales, claws, and beaks. They are mainly composed of α-keratins, found in all vertebrates, and β-keratins, found only in birds and reptiles. Scientists have wondered how keratins are interwoven to form different skin appendages. By studying keratin gene expression patterns in different chicken skin appendages, we found α- and β-keratin interactions crucial for appendage morphogenesis. Mutations in either α- or β-keratins can disrupt keratin expression and cause structural defects. Thus, different combinations of α- and β-keratins contribute to the structural diversity of feathers. The expansion of β-keratin genes during bird evolution might have greatly increased skin appendage diversity because it increased the possible interactions between α- and β-keratins.
          , 
            Avian integumentary organs include feathers, scales, claws, and beaks. They cover the body surface and play various functions to help adapt birds to diverse environments. These keratinized structures are mainly composed of corneous materials made of α-keratins, which exist in all vertebrates, and β-keratins, which only exist in birds and reptiles. Here, members of the keratin gene families were used to study how gene family evolution contributes to novelty and adaptation, focusing on tissue morphogenesis. Using chicken as a model, we applied {RNA}-seq and in situ hybridization to map α- and β-keratin genes in various skin appendages at embryonic developmental stages. The data demonstrate that temporal and spatial α- and β-keratin expression is involved in establishing the diversity of skin appendage phenotypes. Embryonic feathers express a higher proportion of β-keratin genes than other skin regions. In feather filament morphogenesis, β-keratins show intricate complexity in diverse substructures of feather branches. To explore functional interactions, we used a retrovirus transgenic system to ectopically express mutant α- or antisense β-keratin forms. α- and β-keratins show mutual dependence and mutations in either keratin type results in disrupted keratin networks and failure to form proper feather branches. Our data suggest that combinations of α- and β-keratin genes contribute to the morphological and structural diversity of different avian skin appendages, with feather-β-keratins conferring more possible composites in building intrafeather architecture complexity, setting up a platform of morphological evolution of functional forms in feathers.},

	abstract = {This study delves into the intricacies of the evolution of cosmetic marketing, shedding light on emerging trends that are redefining how cosmetic products are sold and perceived. It aims to identify the main trajectories of the cosmetics market and thoroughly explore their potential impact on future marketing strategies. The methodologies used in this study include statistical analysis to decipher market dynamics and forecasts, an in-depth literature review to track market narratives, and a comparative approach to understand the relative impact of each trend. Digging deeper into the results, a major trend was the focus on transparency and clarity of product ingredients. Consumers are leaning towards brands that demonstrate unambiguous ingredient lists and transparent sourcing and production practices. The second key trend is the rapid integration of artificial intelligence and big data technologies into cosmetic marketing. Brands are using {AI}-powered tools to provide personalised product recommendations, predictive marketing, and improve customer experience. In addition, the previously ignored male demographic is becoming a focus, requiring products and marketing campaigns tailored to male sensibilities and needs. The surge in demand for multifunctional cosmetic products, i.e., those that combine multiple benefits, highlights the fourth trend. Consumers are now gravitating towards products that offer multiple benefits by combining skincare and cosmetic benefits. Ultimately, brand loyalty, underpinned by ethical and sustainable practices, is seen as the linchpin of future marketing strategies. The practical implications of this research are multifaceted. For companies operating in the cosmetics market, understanding these trends is not only useful, but also necessary to adapt their strategies to keep them in sync with consumer expectations and ongoing market changes.},

The scientific evidence for their application as active ingredients in anti-aging cosmetics and their flavonoid content was also compiled by searching in online scientific databases. Overall, in 2018, there was a noticeable increase in the use of botanical preparations in anti-aging cosmetics. However, the top three botanical species in both years were Vitis vinifera, Butyrospermum parkii, and Glycine soja, which is consistent with the greater amount of scientific evidence supporting their efficacy. Regarding the function of botanical preparations, there is a clear preference for {DNA}-protecting ingredients. The most prevalent flavonoids were flavan-3-ols, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins.

	abstract = {In this work, we present gel-in-gel water-in-oil (W/O) high internal phase emulsions ({HIPEs}) that feature high stability by structuring both phases of the emulsion. Compared to significant advances made in oil-in-water (O/W) {HIPEs}, W/O {HIPEs} are extremely unstable and difficult to generate without introducing high concentrations of surfactants. Another main challenge is the low viscosity of both water and oil phases which promotes the instability of W/O {HIPEs}. Here, we demonstrate ultrastable W/O {HIPEs} that feature biphasic structuring, in which hydrogels are dispersed in oleogels, and self-forming, low-concentration interfacial Pickering crystals provide added stability. These W/O {HIPEs} exhibit high tolerance toward {pH} shock and destabilizing environments. In addition, this novel ultrastable gel-in-gel W/O {HIPE} is sustainable and made solely with natural ingredients without the addition of any synthetic stabilizers. By applying phase structuring within the {HIPEs} through the addition of various carrageenans and beeswax as structurants, we can increase the emulsion’s stability and viscoelastic rheological properties. The performance of these gel-in-gel W/O {HIPEs} holds promise for a wide range of applications. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated herein the application as a gelled delivery system that enables the co-delivery of hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials at maximized loads, demonstrating high resistance to gastrointestinal {pHs} and a controlled-release profile.},

Here, we analyze spectral emissions from 52 tanning devices in Spanish facilities and compare them with surface solar irradiance for different solar zenith angles. Whereas most of the devices emitted less {UV}-B radiation than the midday summer sun, the unweighted {UV}-A irradiance was 2–6 times higher than solar radiation. Moreover, the spectral distributions of indoor devices were completely different from that of solar radiation, differing in one order of magnitude at some {UV}-A wavelengths, depending on the lamp characteristics. In 21\% of the devices tested, the erythema-weighted irradiance exceeded 0.3Wm−2: the limit fixed by the European standard and the Spanish regulation. Moreover, 29\% of the devices fall within the {UV} type 4 classification, for which medical advice is required. The high variability in erythema-weighted irradiance results in a wide range of exposure times to reach 1 standard erythemal dose ({SED}: 100Jm−2), with 62\% of devices requiring exposures of {\textless}10min to reach 1 {SED}. Nevertheless, the unweighted {UV}-A dose during this time period would be from 1.4 to 10.3 times more than the solar {UV}-A dose.},

{DESIGN}: Open prospective observational study.
{SETTING}: University hospital. Study Subjects Two hundred eighty-five Danish volunteers with apparently healthy skin: children, adolescents, indoor workers, sun worshippers, golfers, and gardeners (age range, 4-68 years). Measurements We developed a personal electronic {UVR} dosimeter in a wristwatch ({SunSaver}) and measured continuously time-related {UVR} doses in standard erythema dose ({SED}) and corresponding sun exposure behavior from diaries, resulting in 346 sun-years (median, 119 days). The estimated yearly {UVR} doses were calculated based on personal and ambient measured doses.
{RESULTS}: The median estimated yearly {UVR} dose was 173 {SEDs} (range, 132 {SEDs} [indoor workers]-224 {SEDs} [gardeners]), with no significant difference by age (P =.25) or sex (P =.75). The {SED} of girls (175 {SEDs}) was significantly (P =.04) higher than that of boys (116 {SEDs}). Subjects younger than 20 years had an increase of 5 {SEDs} per year (P =.03). Sunbathing or exposing shoulders (risk behavior) outside the beach resulted in a median of 2.5 {SEDs} per day in northern Europe and 3.2 {SEDs} per day in southern Europe; however, at the beach, corresponding values were 4.6 and 6.9 {SEDs} per day. Children and adolescents received more than half their total {UVR} dose at the beach. Sunburning doses above 10 {SEDs} per day were connected with sunbathing or exposing shoulders. Of the {UVR} dose, 50\% was received between noon and 3 {PM}. Only the gardeners received most of their {UVR} dose (55\%) on working days.
{CONCLUSIONS}: High {UVR} doses are connected with risk behavior, except for outdoor workers. There is no need to change sun exposure habits on days without risk behavior.},

	volume = {16},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet ({UV}) radiation from the sun is widely considered as a major cause of human skin photoaging and skin cancer. {UV} radiation-induced proinflammatory cytokines mediated by {NF}-{kappaB} reportedly play important roles in photoaging and cancer. {NF}-{kappaB} and cytokines have been thus perceived as molecular targets for pharmacological intervention. With an increasing amount of knowledge of the actions of green tea extracts at cellular and molecular levels, the beneficial effect of drinking green tea has become well recognized if not completely accepted. The components in green tea have even been added to skin-care products unregulated, while the molecular mechanisms of the actions of those components on human skin are being unraveled. Using cultured human keratinocytes, we investigated the effects of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ({EGCG}), a major polyphenolic constituent in green tea, on {UV}-induced activation of transcription factor {NF}-{kappaB} and proinflammatory pathway by measuring nuclear translocation of {NF}-{kappaB} and {IL}-6 secretion in vitro. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis and {ELISA} indicated that both nuclear p65 and secreted {IL}-6 were significantly (p{\textless}0.05) induced by {UVB} (20, 30 {mJ}/cm2) and {UVA} irradiation (10, 20 J/cm2). {NF}-{kappaB} nuclear translocation and {IL}-6 secretion induced by {UVB} and {UVA} were dramatically inhibited by treatment of {EGCG}. {FACS} analysis showed that {EGCG} also inhibited {UVB}-induced apoptosis. {EGCG} recovered {UV}-induced loss of anti-apoptotic component, bcl-2, and inhibited {UV}-induced apoptotic component, Fas ligand, expression. Collectively, we conclude that {EGCG} inhibits {UVB}- and {UVA}-induced proinflammatory pathway and inhibits apoptosis in cultured human keratinocytes in vitro. Our data suggest that {EGCG} be added to cosmetic or skin-care products for prevention from {UV}-induced skin photoaging if this activity can be further confirmed and no cytotoxicity is reported in human skin in vivo.},

	abstract = {Vitamin C and its degradation products participate in chemical modifications of proteins in vivo through non-enzymatic glycation (Maillard reaction) and formation of different products called advanced glycation end products. Vitamin C levels are particularly high in selected tissues, such as lens, brain and adrenal gland, and its degradation products can inflict substantial protein damage via formation of advanced glycation end products. However, the pathways of in vivo vitamin C degradation are poorly understood. Here we have determined the levels of vitamin C oxidation and degradation products dehydroascorbic acid, 2,3-diketogulonic acid, 3-deoxythreosone, xylosone, and threosone in the human lens using o-phenylenediamine to trap both free and protein-bound adducts. In the protein-free fraction and water-soluble proteins ({WSP}), all five listed degradation products were identified. Dehydroascorbic acid, 2,3-diketogulonic acid, and 3-deoxythreosone were the major products in the protein-free fraction, whereas in the {WSP}, 3-deoxythreosone was the most abundant measured dicarbonyl. In addition, 3-deoxythreosone in {WSP} showed positive linear correlation with age (p {\textless} 0.05). In water-insoluble proteins, only 3-deoxythreosone and threosone were detected, whereby the level of 3-deoxythreosone was ∼20 times higher than the level of threosone. The identification of 3-deoxythreosone as the major degradation product bound to human lens proteins provides in vivo evidence for the non-oxidative pathway of dehydroascorbate degradation into erythrulose as a major pathway for vitamin C degradation in vivo.},

	shorttitle = {Vitamin D and the skin},
	abstract = {The keratinocytes of the skin are unique in being not only the primary source of vitamin D for the body, but in possessing both the enzymatic machinery to metabolize the vitamin D produced to active metabolites (in particular 1,25({OH})2D) and the vitamin D receptor ({VDR}) that enables the keratinocytes to respond to the 1,25({OH})2D thus generated. Numerous functions of the skin are regulated by vitamin D and/or its receptor. These include inhibition of proliferation, stimulation of differentiation including formation of the permeability barrier, promotion of innate immunity, regulation of the hair follicle cycle, and suppression of tumor formation. Regulation of these actions is exerted by a number of different coregulator complexes including the coactivators vitamin D receptor interacting protein ({DRIP}) complex also known as Mediator and the steroid receptor coactivator ({SRC}) family (of which {SRC} 2 and 3 are found in keratincytes), the inhibitor hairless (Hr), and β-catenin whose impact on {VDR} function is complex. Different coregulators appear to be involved in different {VDR} regulated functions. This review will examine the various functions of vitamin D and its receptor in the skin, and explore the mechanisms by which these functions are regulated.},

The notion of weighted mean plays a role in descriptive statistics and also occurs in a more general form in several other areas of mathematics.
If all the weights are equal, then the weighted mean is the same as the arithmetic mean.  While weighted means generally behave in a similar fashion to arithmetic means, they do have a few counterintuitive properties, as captured for instance in Simpson's paradox.},

	volume = {10},
	issn = {2218-273X},
	doi = {10.3390/biom10101421},
	abstract = {Rotenone ({ROT}), a plant-derived pesticide is a well-known environmental neurotoxin associated with causation of Parkinson's disease ({PD}). {ROT} impairs mitochondrial dysfunction being mitochondrial complex-I ({MC}-1) inhibitor and perturbs antioxidant-oxidant balance that contributes to the onset and development of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in {PD}. Due to the scarcity of agents to prevent the disease or to cure or halt the progression of symptoms of {PD}, the focus is on exploring agents from naturally occurring dietary phytochemicals. Among numerous phytochemicals, α-Bisabolol ({BSB}), natural monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol found in many ornamental flowers and edible plants garnered attention due to its potent pharmacological properties and therapeutic potential. Therefore, the present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of {BSB} in a rat model of {ROT}-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration, a pathogenic feature of {PD} and underlying mechanism targeting oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. {BSB} treatment significantly prevented {ROT}-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons and fibers in the substantia nigra and striatum respectively. {BSB} treatment also attenuated {ROT}-induced oxidative stress evidenced by inhibition of {MDA} formation and {GSH} depletion as well as improvement in antioxidant enzymes, {SOD} and catalase. {BSB} treatment also attenuated {ROT}-induced activation of the glial cells as well as the induction and release of proinflammatory cytokines ({IL}-1β, {IL}-6 and {TNF}-α) and inflammatory mediators ({iNOS} and {COX}-2) in the striatum. In addition to countering oxidative stress and inflammation, {BSB} also attenuated apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons by attenuating downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, cleaved caspases-3 and 9. Further, {BSB} was observed to attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction by inhibiting mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, cytochrome-C release and reinstates the levels/activity of {ATP} and {MC}-I. The findings of the study demonstrate that {BSB} treatment salvaged dopaminergic neurons, attenuated microglia and astrocyte activation, induction of inflammatory mediators, proinflammatory cytokines and reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic markers. The in vitro study on {ABTS} radical revealed the antioxidant potential of {BSB}. The results of the present study are clearly suggestive of the neuroprotective effects of {BSB} through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in {ROT}-induced model of {PD}.},
